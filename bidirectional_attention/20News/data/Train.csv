i have one complaint for the cameramen doing the jersey pitt series show the shots not the hits on more than one occassion the camera zoomed in on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot they panned back to show the rebound maybe mom s camera people were a little more experienced joseph stiehm exactly that is my biggest complaint about the coverage so far follow that damn puck ravi shah shah pitt edu,1
you should be ashamed to call yourself an ulf samuelson fan anybody who plays the way he does does not belong in the nhl there have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game but a lot of them have been talanted players bobby clarke kenny linsemen pie mckenzie chris chelios etc but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as ulf violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like should have been a women samuelson do n t belong when players like ulf who s main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue and the league wo n t stop it the players should a christian pro qqq aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely if the bruins get a chance to meet pittsburgh in the near future you can bet neely will have his day the sight of watching ulf turtle up like the coward he is is worth almost as much as a stanely cup this wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game if you are to remove ulf samuelson from the lineup the penguins would not even notice he s gone he s an eyesore on the game of hockey .,1
unfortunately that is the way the league is heading you ca n t fight so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when the ref is n t looking ulf has brought this to a high level players stuck in the past like neely who prefer fights to cheap shots are at a disadvantage in the new system lets face it a cheap shot like high sticking is a very effective method it is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way i do n t like it but that s the way the league is going .,1
disclaimer this is for fun in my computerized baseball game i keep track of a category called stolen hits defined as a play made that an average fielder would not make with average effort using the qqq defensive averages posted by sherri nichols thanks sherri i ve figured out some defensive stats for the leftfielders hits stolen have been redefined as plays kevin bass would not have made ok i realize that s unfair kevin s probably the victim of pitching staff fluke shots and a monster park factor but let s put it this way if we replaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with kevin s qqq out making ability how many extra hits would go by to try and correlate it to reality a little more i ve calculated net hits stolen based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make by the same method i ve calculated net extra bases doubles and triples let by finally i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution or dcon basically it represents the defensive contribution of a player i add this number to ops to get dops defense onbase plus slug which should represent the player s total contribution to the team so do n t take it too seriously the formula for dcon appears at the end of this article the short version definition of terms hs hits stolen extra outs compared to kurt stillwell nhs net hits stolen extra outs compared to average fielder ndp net double plays extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder neb net extra bases extra bases prevented compared to avg fielder dcon defensive contribution bases and hits prevented as a rate dops dcon ops quick dirty measure of player s total contribution national league name hs nhs neb dcon dops gonzalez l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq gilkey b qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq clark g qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq alou m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq bonds b qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq may d qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq gant r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq bass k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq ordered by dops qqq bonds qqq gilkey qqq gonzalez qqq alou qqq clark qqq nl average qqq gant qqq may qqq bass american league name hs nhs neb dcon dops raines t qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq anderson b qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq henderson r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq vaughn g qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq gladden d qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq hall m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq mack s qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq polonia l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq mcreynolds k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq maldanado c qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq reimer k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq order by dops qqq henderson qqq anderson qqq raines qqq mack qqq vaughn qqq hall qqq al average qqq maldanado qqq mcreynolds qqq gladden qqq reimer qqq polonia more discussion dcon formula nhs ndp pa nhs ndp neb ab why such a bizzare formula basically it s designed to be added into the ops with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored the extra outs are factored into obp while the extra bases removed are factored into slg that s why i used pa and ab as the divisors for more discussion see the post on hits stolen first base qqq dale j stephenson steph cs uiuc edu baseball fanatic,0

more about the messier samuelsson incident i agree with rick that ulf s cross check was n t illegal it was the kind of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called slo mos sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are besides if messier ca n t take the heat he should stay out of the kitchen well matt mattias timmander has n t been playing with the modo elite league team yet just the modo junior team so i predict he needs a few more years here before he can join the b s i saw him play in the swedish championship game for junior players this year and he played very well a physical game but not the kind of rough stuff that ulfie does i suspect you would like to have a ulf type of player on the b s team too as for mariusz czerkawski he has had a great season for hammarby in division qqq he scored if i remember correctly qqq points this season and then we have to keep in mind that a qqq point season in sweden is considered very good due to the limited number of games mariusz is djurgarden property he was just on loan to hammarby so he will play in elitserien next season unless the b s can get him of course i would say that mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to watch in swedish hockey this season staffan,1

amazingly pitchers no matter how good their mechanics are not machines cy young winners do n t pitch in a vaccuum unaware of how their offenses are doing the braves pitching staff is already showing signs of cracking under the strain of knowing they re not going to get many if any runs unfortunately the braves pitchers were so bad for so long that the organization put so much stress and i mean stress on pitching that they completely ignored hitting the braves right now are looking woefully similar to the braves of the mid seventies heaven help us .,0
well i m a wings fan and i think the first thing that you should do is to get the opponent s line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone with them there is no yzerman fedorov probert line except for maybe on a powerplay these three players usually play on three different lines which would mean that toronto s checking line would have to pull a triple shift the wings lines usually look like this gallant yzerman ciccarelli kozlov fedorov drake kennedy burr probert ysebaert primeau sheppard oh by the way start praying ),1
actually gaetti s first year with california was qqq his qqq da was n t out of line with his career averages and his qqq was actually below average in qqq but check out the last three years at the metrodome qqq gaetti qqq al avg qqq qqq pags qqq leius qqq al avg qqq qqq leius qqq al avg qqq for the last three years the highest das in either league have been posted by minnesota players three different ones including one pags who was mediocre to horrible elsewhere that does n t prove a park effect is at work any more than san diego s horrible infield numbers prove a park effect is at work but it looks like a strong possibility to me lots and it might even be a nice play to thrid base dale j stephenson steph cs uiuc edu baseball fanatic,0
how long can the leafs play short handed and still be expected to score they did some fine penely killing in the first qqq men down for a couple of minutes at one point but they just could n t keep it up they spent virtually the entire game either short handed or just coming off a penelty as soon as they d get re grouped they re penalized again sheesh like gilmour said after the qqq you ca n t go calling every little push an shove in a game like that and if you re going to you have to do it for both teams pearson one of my four favorite leafs played like a bonehead i saw him personally screw up at least qqq good scoring opportunities and then he got that bonehead qqq major high sticking penalty cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand full of games ago and he played a good game if the other players on his line can smarten up that line should do okay clark s got to get tough he s got to intimidate and go for the net send clark up the left wing over the blue line a couple times his patented wrist shot will put some numbers on the board and pearson heck maybe he should be benched i hate to repeat grapes but where the heck was foligno zezel ca n t do all the checking himself and get macllwain on the move we need some speed out there keep potvin in net he did okay considering although like i said a couple weeks ago potvin messed up in a couple games in the ahl playoffs last year he can easily do it again my prediction last week was toronto in qqq that the games det wins will be blow outs and the game tor wins will be close i still stand by that do n t fret leafs fans in order to win in qqq the other team has to win qqq burns is going to make some magic he ll mix up some lines match the wings line per line he ll have his team checking hard and he ll never let them get out numbered in their own end the leafs will win wednesday night and will take qqq or their home games probably the first one .,1

while i will first congratulate the blues for their victory i think it must be realized that the primary reason the blues were able to win was curtis joseph when a goalkeeper gets hot there is little an opposing team can do joseph should be given the entire city of st louis because otherwise there would probably be a game qqq scheduled as for the game on sunday the blues caught a few breaks without a doubt one was the referee constantly watching the blackhawks looking for reasons to give them penalties second the blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the blackhawks attempted to clear no linesman no shot for brett i can redirect anything hull to redirect on another of st louis goals belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who did n t belong in the crease which means it was a st louis player finally the overtime goal was caused because someone kept belfour from getting back to the crease no goalie no way to stop the shot i congratulate st louis for beating the hawks it will be a shame to see bryan murray finally advance to the campbell conference finals because joseph wo n t be able to stop the powerful red wing attack _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _,1

sorry i still do n t buy it you re certainly right that the runner is not out merely for running out of the baseline he must interfere with the play but the argument here is over what constitutes interference you certainly can not infer from what you ve quoted that the batter runner must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference you have n t posted a definition of interference at all imo this calls for one of the approved ruling s that go in small print in the rulebook something like approved ruling if in the judgement of the umpire the runner by running to the left of the allowed path caused the fielder to make a bad throw blocks the vision of the fielder receiving the throw or otherwise impedes the defensive team s making a play on him the batter runner shall be judeged guilty of interference or approved ruling the runner can not be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball in the absence of such an approved ruling i claim that this is a poor rules trivia question since it can not be authoritatively answered .,0

so all us hockey automobile racing fans all know exactly where we stand espn delays the martinsville race by a day for the nfl draft espn shows baseball instead of the overtime of a nhl playoff game gimme a break guys does anyone know why this race is tape delay especially until monday is this the weekend for the nfl draft if so postponing the race for a day is a real slap in the face for racing fans i m afraid you re right as usual as i recall they ve been doing this ever since they started covering the draft live i wish they could work out some kind of a deal with somebody else such as tnn to get the race on live but i guess espn is n t much into sharing it also clarifies where auto racing stands on their priority list as if we did n t already know -,1

well i agree that if you re going to stand in front of the net that you should expect to get hit and hacked at in general you should expect to finish the game with some bruises however there is a fine line between hacking at a guy causing some pain and discomfort and blatantly attempting to injure another player felix potvin imo crossed that line on wednesday that two hander on ciccarelli was way out of line i lost a lot of respect for potvin because of that it showed an immaturity he did not slash at ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area a legal position for dino to be in instead he slashed in an attempt to injure it was out of shear frustration as a leaf supporter just a supporter i m not a leaf fan really i was very disappointed you re right in mentioning billy smith and ron hextall at least in his philly days they both crossed that same line at times and for that reason many fans and players disliked them that s why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues let s hope that felix does n t do that again i d hate to see anyone even dino although i admit i do n t like him very much get seriously hurt from such careless but intentional use of the stick .,1
good question it s my impression not backed by evidence that general south of the borderness seems to exempt one from the hiring firing effect i was talking about back in the qqq s there were some attempts to hire black cuban ballplayers they were rejected by the commissioner and others well what did i mean to say aside from some short lived exceptions such as japanese internment in ww ii only blacks were affected by laws regarding slavery jim crow miscegenation military service etc if my claim of exclusivity is not qqq airtight that is if you can come up with this or that exception fine have a cookie but compared to this list no other racial group put up with a legal onslaught worth discussing at length .,0

but it is subject to all kinds of bias and is almost completely useless for first basemen from the raw stats there is no way to tell which of a first baseman s putouts were made on throws from other fielders and which were made on his own plays likewise you ca n t tell whether a double play was qqq qqq qqq or qqq qqq qqq fielding runs thus gives a first baseman no credit for putouts or double plays only for assists and errors it thus favors first basemen who play deep reaching a lot of balls but forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently it also hurts first baseman who play behind left handed pitching staffs and thus face few left handed batters this is better of course it still is n t all of a first baseman s defense defensive average which uses larger and probably better zones has mattingly tied for second in the league while qqq batting runs is good it is mostly in the past the runs he produced in qqq do n t say much about his value in qqq .,0

"ten years ago the number of europeans in the nhl was roughly a quarter of what it is now going into the qqq season the numbers of euros on nhl teams have escalated to the following stats canadians qqq americans qqq europeans qqq please note that these numbers are rounded off and taken from the top qqq players on each of the qqq teams my source is the vancouver sun here s the point there are far too many europeans in the nhl i am sick of watching a game between an american and a canadian team let s say the red wings and the canucks and seeing names like bure konstantinov and borshevshky is this north america or is n t it toronto detriot quebec and edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of euros on other teams is getting worse as well i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about pavel bure the russian rocket i will completely throw up as it is now every time i see the canucks play i keep hoping someone will cross check bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher by the way i m not a canucks fan to begin with okay the stretcher remark was a little carried away but the point is that i resent nhl owners drafting all these europeans instead of canadians and some americans it denies young canadians the opportunity to play in their north american league and instead gives it to europeans who are n t even better hockey players it s all hype this european mystique is sickening but until nhl owners get over it canadian and american players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating the problem is clearly only getting worse i m all for the creation of a european hockey league and let the bures and selannes of the world play on their own continent i just do n t want them on mine richard j rauser you have no idea what you re doing rauser sfu ca oh do n t worry about that we re professional wni outlaws we do this for a living """,1
i d be willing to make two wagers qqq snow does n t win roy qqq mattingly is out of baseball within five years i m skeptical of the first because i do n t think snow is that good a player and he is on a losing team i m skeptical of the second because of his back mattingly is qqq this year and how many players play until they are qqq not too many and most of them did n t have chronic back problems when they were qqq could be wrong on either or both but i think that s the smart way to bet .,0

once again the rockies bullpen fell apart andy ashby pitched six somewhat shaky innings giving up just one run then game the dreaded relief three picthers combined to give up qqq runs one each i believe in the qqq inning and blew the save opportunity final was qqq qqq vs expos despite their problems in the pen i think the rockies are a team that wo nt be taken lightly going into today s game the had the league s leading hitter and rbi man galarraga two of the leaders in stolen bases young and cole and increasingly strong starting pitching david rex wood davewood cs colorado edu university of colorado at boulder,0
attention penguins fans once again apparently qqq of you understand that this was just a joke hence the next to it but one idiot on here does n t as he got pissed at me and sent me two hate e mails telling me that this is wrong i have no intentions of sending e mail to anyone should the pens win tonight and i really do not expect do not intend to lead any of you to send this poster e mail either it was not a serious request if you did n t know that which you probably did then do n t do it thanks .,1
well here it is nhl in the year qqq i got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and although i initially thought i had just been taking too many too strong drugs now it seems the realization has really begun you can see the league has already started to move to this direction the walt disney conference anaheim mighty chipmunks franchise name to be changed after each new la kings hockey movie la flames we ve seen some of that san jose sharks san diego bruins tijuana red wings detroit s hockey team will follow its car industry dallas stars houston oilers texas rangers seattle canucks the norm green conference alabama white hawks biloxi blues tampa bay lightning miami blades helsinki jets you ve heard them starting getting used to the anthem montreal quebecois sp there will be no canada atlanta devils orlando penquins key west islanders hartford whalers the whalers will never move huh palm beach capitals now that the anahaim team is becomming real i m really beginning to believe the rest of the message i m sure the future will turn you into believers too after qqq the nhl will abandond ice rinks it s so expensive to cool down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is anyway nhl will become a roller skating hockey league that way it can create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the game in their back yards !,1
gaetz wo n t be back there s been rumors he was officially released right at the end of the season when his contract expired but i have n t seen confirmation it was clear from my talks with the sharks doctors that he was n t going to make it for a while and the sharks would have to sign him to a contract which given his problems competing at the ihl level this spring does n t make sense .,1
this is incorrect this year the pens had qqq games on free tv and qqq games on ppv next year they will have qqq games on free tv and qqq on a subscription basis you actually get qqq more free game than last year and there will be no more radio only games its a good deal last year everybody bitched about baldwin breaking up the team now he goes out of his way to keep the nucleus of this team together and that takes money he comes up with a creative way to generate more revenue so he can afford this team and people bitch some more everybody wants something for nothing dean -,1
the major problem with this analysis is that it ignores age even if morris were performing as well as clemens right now and were likely to this season nobody would trade clemens for morris straight up because clemens has more of his career left .,0
right most definitely this may be the root of the confusion please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind note that i am not yet saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand suppose we have a simplified lotto game you pick a number from qqq qqq and win if that number is drawn suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week in the first year of the game approximately qqq of the population will win qqq or more times in the second year of the game qqq of those qqq winners will again be qqq winners in the third year of the game qqq of those who won qqq or more times in each of the first two years will win qqq again suppose i started with qqq people in my population after three years i have qqq people who have consistently in each of the last three years won qqq or more the number of times expected do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game no because we know there is no skill involved nothing about these consistent winners can influence their chances of winning but suppose we do n t know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic or something how would we test this hypothesis we can look for correlations in the population now most of the population will show zero correlation but our psychics should show a high positive correlation even if they are n t very good psychics they should still manage to win qqq or more times most years net result a small positive correlation over the entire population well zero correlation is zero correlation you mention that sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last qqq years but if we look at the past we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent the length of the streak does n t seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year is there any reason to expect this streak to be different from past streaks now if it were true that qqq of all three year streaks remained true to form then we might have something useful but then we would n t have zero correlation instead we have qqq of all three year streaks remain true to form and qqq of all three year streaks reverse you look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year but it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year since the probabilities are split qqq qqq each way then we would have something useful and we would also have a positive correlation but for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses .,0

a hem two words russell davis playing in the cavern at albany aa last year qqq down the alleys and to center davis went qqq with qqq homers there are n t any small parks on the road in the eastern league either he s qqq and his mle was qqq qqq hr i have no fielding statistics but from seeing him a number of times last year i d say that he s not brooks robinson but neither is he howard johnson unless they think they can win the pennant this year which seems possible and need boggs to do it i think they re making the same sort of mistake with davis that boston made with boggs leaving him in the minors for two or three years after he d shown that he was a good hitter hrm they still have him on the roster qqq ab through the first two weeks they ve just never figured out what to do with him i suspect that he hits enough especially vs lefties to be a reasonable shortstop one rumor running around during spring training was that they wanted to convert silvestri to be a catcher because his body type was wrong for a shortstop you d think that somebody in the same division who plays baltimore about a dozen times a year would know better mike jones aix high end development mjones donald aix kingston ibm com,0
well as a hockey fan i think it s terrible it s one thing to say hey let s give a hockey team to cities that do n t have one that s fine it s entirely another to say okay let s take a team from a thriving hockey town and move it of course none of us will ever know the real inside story but from what i know a group of minneapolis businessmen told green repeatedly that they would purchase the remaining qqq season tickets to get to the qqq level that green wanted yet he refused every time it s pretty obvious that he was determined to get out of minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets thing as an excuse i was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game and the fans were great people were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the parking lot before the game the attendance was so full as to have sro and the whole atmosphere in the centre was terrific minnesota is hockey usa how the nhl can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond me i only hope they get a new team soon just my qqq ali .,1

yes everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are finally moving in the right direction they should finish over qqq this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in august however i would take back a few moves qqq the jim abbott trade i think abbott is not only an inspirational person but a great pitcher also he could win the cy young this year but he wo n t because the right side of the yanks infield is n t good enough so why was this not a good trade jt snow how many rookies have been able to step in and immediately have the impact that he has had so far on the angels i know it s early but if you ve seen this kid hit field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be a tremendous player the yanks should have kept him what about mattingly you ask well it s great that the yanks have taken care of him and remained loyal but he s qqq years older than snow and just does n t have the same bat speed as before his back injury it s a shame but as a yankee fan who wants to see the best yankee team i d take snow over mattingly at first the yanks also gave up two promising propects with snow for abbott besides with domingo jean brien taylor wickman militello and sterling hitchcock they are just loaded with propects i know abbotts only qqq but this was too much to give up i believe george forced this trade because he believes and he s right that abbott will be a big hit in ny however i d like to see the yankees build a baseball team not an amusement show qqq wade boggs i live in boston and like wade a lot but his career is winding down and i would rather see the yanks start to develop a long term solution i e hensley muelins russ davis velarde besides wade just does n t have any range what a shame about charlie hayes huh qqq spike owen see wade boggs i d much rather see them develop dave silvestri or whoever wade and spike next to each other in the infield is going to raise the yankee staff era qqq point and these guys are on the down sides of their careers qqq danny tartabull yes he s put up some tremendous numbers and it s nice to think about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year but he never is we should expect qqq games max out of him meanwhile gerald williams is playing at columbus and paul o neil is playing left field i believe o neil led nl outfielders in assists last year and tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder what i m basically getting at is the yanks are moving in the right direction but are not ready to win a pennent this year they should at the gm level be planning for a qqq or qqq world series this means getting the younger players experience in the majors now so they will be ready in a year or two i m afraid that all this stuff wreaks of george steinbrenner certainly the boggs deal was all george it looks like george is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now the veterans are always available and can be added at any time like boston did this year develop the young players first then add the one or two veterans or in the yankees case just keep them let s all us yankee fans hope that george does n t dismantle the terrific job stick and company have done building the yankee organization back into one of respect i m really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today relief pitching for example george must realize that the yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away have patience george and we will all enjoy the future fire bucky and trade the kids and it s baseball hell for all loyal yankee fans for a long time !,0
qqq hitting hawks tried to outmuscle blues but could not do it instead blues matched hawks hit for hit and crunched the shit out of them in game qqq scud line shanahan butcher and zombo particularly took turns bashing favorite targets like chelios qqq skating when the hawks tried to outskate blues they could not do that either nelson emerson finally showed up and skated circles around flat footed chicago defense hedican felsner ron wilson and others also proved that with old cement skaters like goulet and keith brown blues could lap chicago in a qqq m relay race i agree with qqq but you are wrong about qqq in fact the only point where the hawks in any way matched the blues was when they quit trying to outmuscle and instead tried to outskate the blues they scored and took the lead too bad it was game qqq and they then took some stupid penalties when the hawks skated they outskated the blues and took control .,1
my apologies for the typo i meant the wings had qqq power plays in the first period and the leafs none as well my point is n t that the refs were biased just that they were calling a lot of penalties which works to the benefit of the wings having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then calling a bunch against the other to make up for it takes a lot away from what could have been a great game .,1

hmmmmmm i think i ll let everyone make there own comment on this one neilson and smith are bad kovalev is magical .,1
kovalev is too talented a player to play for roger nielson roger needs players who ca n t think for themselves and can only skate in straight lines up and down the ice dudley and nielson are the only two coaches bad enough in the league to take talents like mogilny and kovalev and not know how to turn them into bure and selanne get muckler as coach and kovalev will look like mogilny the trouble with the rangers is that neil smith went out and got players like messier kovalev and graves who have been schooled in taking the game to their opponent and attacking while hiring coaches who are interested in rope a dope strategies if you want the roger nielsons of the world to be your coach you do n t go out and get a mark messier who is an old dog who ca n t learn new tricks from a known loser and you do n t waste your draft picks on players like kovalev gerald,1
so in other words if roussel shuts out the sharks and soderstrom shuts out the penguins that s immaterial because it was the coaches decision come on joe think about what you re saying who they played is very significant why they played them is what s irrelevent a low gaa against good teams is better than a low gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders a low gaa is better then a higher gaa a low gaa against good teams is much much better than a higher gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders yes it does absolutely in the context of comparing two goaltenders of course at the end of the season qqq points is qqq points no matter how you get them and on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts but if you re a coach deciding between two goalies or a gm looking to make a trade you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets i did n t see the second toronto game but the first one was a defensive masterpiece there was nothing in that game to judge tommy soderstrom on because he was n t tested the same for roussel in the ranger game two real scoring chances one he made a great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player if you were judging roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by but if you were to look at the qqq qqq tie against the habs you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout that was a qqq goalie in action roussel does n t have a game like that in him do n t be so sure of that flyers management never says bad thing about roussel but they do n t say too much on the good side either i ve seen at least two interviews where every time farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders it was tommy this tommy that and oh yeah dom has played well too flyers in the nhl hall of fame kinda dull really they handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from pizza hut but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid season had names like benning kasper mostly random seat locations some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos i do n t like that method since i ve seen guards help out people get things like lindros pictures surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they d hold em for their buddies .,1

i ve been following the giants closely over the off season newspapers notesgroup etc but i had my first up close and personal last night at the stick after watching giants hitters struggle last year barry s swing was very impressive he s very quick and his swing seems effortless even compared to clark particularly clark as of late it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well i m not sure if barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits qqq qqq hr for qqq rbi s the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to bonds there has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better clayton s defense has been superb mcgee seems to like leading off this year manwaring is driving the ball so on so forth i hope it continues i think they need to continue well into june before people are really sold that they are for real particularly the pitching for myself i think the fresh start of magowan baker etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year .,0

why do you expect him to remain the best shortstop in the game until he reaches his seventy third birthday or something why is it such a strange concept that a forty one year old ozzie smith might be a defensive liability in qqq ?,0

know he now and michael jackson jack nicholson and bill cosby would n t be making near as much money if they were n t entertainers so what s your point for a hurting will they you ca n t usually take away one of the team s best players and still expect them to win or do you think the pirates will continue to win without barry bonds athletic working so again jack nicholson gets paid much more than most hard working citizens and much more than rickey henderson for that matter when the million also the reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks start making the real big salaries late in their career when they are on the decline there are exceptions of course dave parker fell apart after making his first million because he put most of that million up his nose ),0
stole qqq bases ok he s still light hitting but baseball managers do n t think so they think he like omar moreno before him is a perfect leadoff man awesome defense he s still around because of his qqq when he hit qqq hr has n t played qqq years in the bigs was n t a full time major leaguer until qqq consistent qqq hitter we ll see if he s still around in qqq for his tenth year same goes for herm does n t count then redus is hardly light hitting plus he stole qqq bases close to qqq ops career against lhp we ll see if he s still around in qqq to qualify slugged qqq to qqq for three straight years in one of the worst hitters parks in the nl he s going to be one of colorado s better players this year plus to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in denver and buffalo and hawaii while with the white sox coleman assuming he makes it to qqq was never perceived as being weak offensively though of course he was led nl in sb his first six years in the majors we ll see if he s still around in qqq wilson has always been overrated but hit qqq five times in a six year stretch and led the league in triples five times but we can count him if he s still playing in qqq though it ll be because he s otis nixon deluxe with slightly worse defense okay if he s in the league this year he can count though he s also in the majors because of otis nixon syndrome he s not spectacular but he s neither light hitting nor a ten year man halfway there and unlikely to make it qqq of the way there brock suffered from otis nixon disease but he was n t perceived as light hitting neither was curt flood cesar cedeno was not light hitting he ll have to steal a lot more bases .,0
sorry but this is the biggest load of bunk i ve seen in a while a the pirates have been trying to trade lavalliere for some time now nobody was even vaguely interested b several other teams had made it known that they would grab prince who was out of options c lavalliere s release had nothing to do with him being through he was released because in the event of an injury to slaught lavalliere is no longer capable they believe of being the everyday catcher since slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties the offense should actually improve with this move .,0
this was a concession to mansbridge and cbc news they argued that if you re going to play havoc with the schedule you should at least make sure that prime time is aired as soon as possible news got a commitment that the post game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to ptn within one minute or so of the game ending as for the earlier comments about cbc being ontariocentric frankly the no doubleheader decison goes both ways people in the west ca nt see the leafs and people in central canada ca n t see the jets game the reason for the decision was cbc s feeling they could n t sell advertising for six hours of hockey in one night as for who wants to see news over hockey a lot of people cbc always gets plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule .,1

you re definitely correct in that williams absolutely has to be sandwiched in between clark and bonds he must and i mean must get fastballs to hit otherwise he becomes little more than sixto lezcano in disguise what i would suggest is perhaps batting bonds williams and clark qqq qqq qqq the reason being that i feel bonds potential basestealing abilities are wasted when he s stuck behind two slow runners i think the chance of getting qqq qqq extra stolen bases with bonds in the qqq spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having clark in the qqq spot .,0

we can not isolate completely roger but we can make a pretty good estimate i wo n t claim to split hairs and say that we can really measure who was better robby alomar or carlos baerga last year the difference is too close to call but larkin and lee clemens and morris the differences are too great there in your measure of the game why should a team that has just won it all ever replace a single player since they are now clearly best how can they do better yet every team can always find someplace where they beleive they can improve the team they can always find a player a little better than one they already have btw by my definitions the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team win i will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the team by having aptitudes one team needs more than others baseball is a team game but it is made of individual talents it is absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success or failure of his teammates whom he did not choose at least in most cases morris won last year because he played on a team with joe carter robby alomar tom henke juan guzman john olerud et al clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as herm winninham luis rivera and jeff reardon to define the quality of the team as a sum of its components as i do albeit imperfectly is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the mean quality of the team as my reading of your arguments suggests you do ),0

stuff deleted the last year before bryan murray took over the wings did not make the playoffs while they had been considered a possible contender when jacques demers first arrived in his last two years they were respectively embarrassed in the first round by chicago and then failed to make the playoffs at a time a might add when there were only five teams in the norris it s true that vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before quinn came but in those years the smythe division was a lot i mean a lot tougher division than the norris also known as the snorris division vancouver had to play edmonton and calgary both very legitimate stanley cup contenders eight times a year while detroit got to play such powerhouses as toronto and minnesota now edmonton is hardly even a force in the league and the smythe even has the mighty san jose sharks while over this same period of time in which vancouver was improving so was everybody in the norris except st louis detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division they had to improve a lot to get better than their competition in the norris bryan murray inherited a team with very little talent for really good players they had yzerman burr and probert and that was about it and no doubt some will dispute whether burr and probert were that good the rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans the only reason they got as far as they did in the years before murray came was due to the coaching of demers who at least at first got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team then even his coaching began to degrade there are a number of reasons why detroit was n t in as bad a shape standings wise when murray took over as vanc was when quinn took over some of which i outlined above but murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did quinn with the exception of yzerman and one player can not alone make a team into a stanley cup contender as i m sure everyone reading this will agree we ll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they face each other in the conference final assuming they do n t get knocked out like last year .,1
re eric true but fortunately we did n t get to find out what they would be like without recchi for qqq games soderstrom absolutely qqq shutouts in qqq games for a rookie without a lot of defense in front of him runnerups to galley and fedyk who are scoring a ton over their career best but galley thinks he s paul coffey puts scoring ahead of defending and fedyk has tailed off big time eklund was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries qqq points in qqq games is not bad at all and recently he s been a huge factor in the wins they ve gotten eklund has never had a point a game season in his career his production is very typical for him how does he qualify as a disappointment if anything he s a surprise my choice would be roussel if i went strictly by what was expected of players but i never thought that he had what it takes to be a qqq goalie my biggest disappointment is bill dineen i thought that he was going to be the perfect coach for this young team instead he s made too many bad moves and imho has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year any coach that thinks putting eric lindros at the point on power plays is a bright idea needs to go back to coaching school .,1

no no no the ack man is apparently an alien life form much like the pod people from planet mars who can take on any form the ability remains the same however the ack people have been spotted on many teams to date but it appears that the orioles staff mentioned above and the expos bullpen barnes walton fassero gardiner and rojas have been the prime target apparently john wetteland was roughed up by the ack people during spring training due to the fact that his system rejected the takeover and has been on the dl ever since contact the authorities this evil plot must be stopped the ack people can keep jack morris and juan guzman though i enjoy watching toronto fans suffer too much to want these guys returned to normal scot scot hughes department of chemical engineering expos in qqq falcon cs mcgill ca mcgill university montreal quebec witty saying here },0

i could n t agree more the jays have a lot of power in their line up so far pitching has been the biggest problem maybe we can get acker back one incident that sticks out in my mind was when derek bell ran back out on to the feild after the jays had won the division and all the players were back in the clubhouse bell ran around the field with his arms in the air waving a big towel over his head he looked like a big jerk especially when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole season the next day winfield and carter somehow got the keys to bell s jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started the stadium announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for bell s jeep bell really freaked out i do n t think bell was to popular after that i think that jackson might be trying a little too hard right now he s known for being a great outfielder and he s not the only blue jay who has been booting balls and playing generally awful andrew,0

hartford goal gord hynes misplayed the puck at the flyers blue line and nylander stripped him and took off the recchi goal was a qqq on qqq with lindros the bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie on the second nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in this is the most frustrating part of the flyers defense take the body and if they get one shot and beat you fine do n t give them another chance carkner galley and mcgill are all terrible about this i ll bet money at least one of them was the closest flyer to the play that s all i have my radio got bad after that and i was lucky to know who it was that scored much less how from what i heard roussel had a very strong game after the game gene hart asked bobby taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game it was garry galley qqq for his career high point total i m surprised that a former goalie would n t look closer at his defensive play tommy soderstrom qqq for his team record tying qqq shutouts in only about qqq a season and mark recchi qqq for his all time high team single season scoring mark but here s the odd part he could n t decide between lindros and recchi for number qqq if he picks recchi as qqq after he had a hard time choosing between him and lindros does n t that make lindros qqq what you wanna know my three stars of the season well since you asked qqq eric lindros eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice the difference between the team s record with him and without him is no accident i believe that the team could have been almost as successful without recchi there is no question that this team is significantly better with eric lindros on it and i think that he will deservedly wear the c on his jersey next season qqq tommy soderstrom qqq shutouts was second in the league to only ed belfour and tommy did n t have a chris chelios booo in front of him he also did n t play a complete season due to heart problems sentimental edge here my family has a history of heart problems there s no question in my mind that tommy soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future and if roussel complains again about being number qqq look for him to be traded within qqq years qqq mark recchi again you ca n t argue with an all time team high single season scoring mark there are an awful lot of teams that did n t have a single player get as many points plus mark is the only flyer to play the entire season not a tough choice honorable mentions rod brind amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year the difference was that he was n t on the top line this year and did n t get as much playing time then again he did n t get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either dimtri yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman yes he made rookie mistakes but he was usually fast enough to make up for them i have a feeling that with his shot he ll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone and i suspect that he ll be the teams top defenseman in years to come garry galley was the team s point leader from defensemen again there are some things you just ca n t argue with and he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game and that was against his wishes under doctors orders but his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution a little more caution and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year brent fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total but consistency became a problem for him a couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members tom misnik a member

i think a compromise would work namely honouring personages in conference names and using geographical references in the divisional names although i still do not think the move will draw fans to the game imo it s a cosmetic change that bettman and the owners _ hope _ will have an effect and it does n t say much for the mentality of anybody it works on either surprise i agree totally the points system is fine if everybody at all times has played the same number of games since this is almost never the case winning percentage is the way to go i do n t particularly care if it is an american thing either if it works .,1

i really think that this is the key point when i saw the incident on baseball tonight sunday i could n t believe how far away from the plate gant went then he casually leaned against his bat i do n t blame the umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch the worst part of the whole incident was the braves coming out onto the field what were they going to do attack the umpire the only people who should ve been out there were cox and maybe the coaches but no players i agree with the person who posted before that cox should be suspended for having no control over his team .,0

is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly rbi s this is the situation that brought the question up the red sox were up in the bottom of the qqq by a score of qqq qqq the mariners had the bases loaded with qqq out the batter hits a fly to center which the fielder catches the runner at third tags and scores without a throw now without a judgement call and i do n t think there is one this is an rbi for the batter it seems to me that a better name for this would be defensive indifference since it does n t really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point i know i can think of several if the mariners stole third and second which opening the base would allow and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third he would n t have a play at home third or second for the out and maybe he therefore ca n t make the throw to first to get the last out etc scenarios too but does it _ really _ matter if this guy scores this way when you re down by qqq if the tying run is going to score so is the guy on third the point is that the batter imo should n t get credit an rbi for utterly failing to do his job which at this point is to get a hit or a walk not trade an out for one run what do you guys think ?,0

first a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball the lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches and while it s true that the gaps between plays can be interesting this is only true when they do n t become extra long quickly pitched games can grab and hold your attention much better bring back the two hour baseball game and the three and a half hour golf game with it ),0

yes but this is irrelevant you re talking about averages when we have lots of information about this player in particular to base our decisions on i might as well say we know that very very few people are more than qqq feet tall so chances are that manute bol is really only qqq foot qqq why is n t lopez likely to hit that well he hit that well last year after adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an absolute scale than olson or berryhill did by a lot as for rushing if there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i do n t believe there is then would n t you rather waste lopez s qqq old good season than his qqq old very good season or his qqq old excellent season the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to use the point was not that qqq ab is a significant sample but rather that he had n t done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him down until he gets warmed up most players are never ready for the bigs what does this have to do with javy lopez see above but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds most players are n t that good so they probably wo n t be that good this year either and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble not superstars not stars not even good players maybe average if we re being charitable ummm justice is a very fine hitter pendleton might have another big year in his bat but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell gant is a big question mark the bream hunter platoon is decent not excellent and has rotten obp or slg depending on who s in blauser is a very valuable bat for a shortstop wanna bet the difference between lopez s bat and olson berryhill could be qqq or qqq runs over the course of the season given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play i ll take the latter every time just like keith mitchell did that was me and you so far your only counter proposal is that they really do n t understand how good lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two i think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization well argued but inflammatory reply deleted ],0
i am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here if you asked somone who had never heard of hockey before if la played in the smythe division what do you think that the response would be what if you asked this person if la played in the west division the naming of divisions after long dead entrepreneurs is unnecessary obfuscation hardly the established situation existed prior to smythe et al the stanley cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge what our dear founders did was formalize the challenge they created a closed league an oligop olistic professional system in the interests of making money wheth er or not that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable we are however stuck with their invention and that de bate is academic the point to be made however is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey long before smythe and his pals showed up what s wrong with best defenceman period was there ever a better defenceman was there ever a better player and if you think that bruce norris contribution was somehow more significant than bobby orr s then in the interests of education why do n t you take a poll and find out how many people know who norris was but you do n t have to do you so you do n t feel that you should have to make the effort to remember that vancouver plays in the west division or pacific or whatever other intuitively understandable moniker is chosen and of course you neatly deleted jason s jingoistic rant about the game losing its canadianization quoting me out of context does more to erode your credibility than it does mine my position is clearly progressive and is anything but biased closed minded ig norant arrogant i will grant you nice try john but for a flame to be truly effective you have to display at least enough intelligence to earn your target s respect cordially as always rm,1

well the tentative rules anyway and of course since the season is not entirely over tentative entry form but who cares the real hockey season is starting here s the deal you email preferably or post your predictions and the number of games you think each series will go each round will be weighted so that the stanley cup finals will be very important but the early rounds will still be important here is the scoring pick qqq round winner way off on games qqq points pick qqq round winner within one game qqq points pick qqq round winner pick of games qqq points pick qqq round winner way off on games qqq points pick qqq round winner within one game qqq points pick qqq round winner pick of games qqq points pick conference champ way off on games qqq points pick conference champ within one game qqq points pick conference champ pick of games qqq points pick stanley cup champ way off on games qqq points pick stanley cup champ within one game qqq points pick stanley cup champ pick of games qqq points pick loser in qqq series goes qqq qqq points pick loser in qqq series decided in game qqq ot qqq points these last two are sympathy points probably wo n t happen anyway obviously picking the stanley cup champion is important i will do some tests to see if the format is fair but probably i will be too lazy to modify it so the scoring will probably be like this as for entry forms well this post is getting too long so see next post keith keller let s go rangers let s go quakers kkeller mail sas upenn edu ivy league champs !,1

stuff deleted as i recall the author of the _ original _ article that started the thread claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons roger on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a jingoistic rant but you also supported the name changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent fwiw i do not think the flaming was warranted nor do i think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all just an observation however that aside the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it making it easier for the casual fan or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour imo the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports in addition i do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey so it s a pointless exercise anyway if the current names are inappropriate then that is a separate issue not central to the original article something to consider additionally is whether or not players like orr who contributed to the glory of the sport would have been able to do so _ without _ an organized professional league to play in in this case honouring builders of the _ league _ as opposed to builders of the _ sport _ becomes a chicken and egg type question although it was the chicken dunno if the stein comparison is justifiable since it does n t look as though his unanimous acceptance to the hall will hold up .,1

some discussion about whether elias is money grubbing deleted some thoughts and facts qqq bill james is a partial owner of stats inc however he has almost nothing to do with the day to day operations of the company although he does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name the handbook but not the scoreboard to the best of my knowledge the only things that bill actually writes for stats are the predictions section of the handbook and the bill james fantasy baseball rulebook qqq the debate over elias goes way back bill james early stuff was hampered by the fact that elias would not give access to their stats at any price project scoresheet and later stats were founded to fill this void you can call stats and ask them for a report on just about anything in their database and they will provide it for a price of course or you could just log into their online system and look at the data yourself having attempted to pry numbers from elias in the past football not baseball they just do n t do that in stats eyes the high ground comes from making the information available at all qqq that being said i m pretty dissapointed by bill s book this year too i am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers desire to have the book come out sooner than april hope this makes things just a little bit clearer bias alert i am a former part time employee of stats ),0
as if an aluminum stick being taken to ulf s head is gon na solve the problem with violence in the sport of hockey how the hell can you say the guy is a goon and justify it with your back assward mentality saying that hurting a player will solve anyone s problems is asinine new rules and a new referee system need to be instituted right now too many of the real goons get away with too much because the ref is watching the play or supposed to be i ve seen koharski and van hellemond to name a few with their heads up their asses on a few calls rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the play even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties it would be an improvement .,1

i m not sure i understand this question when the if rule is invoked the batter is automatically out this relieves the runners from being forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught other than that is n t it just the same as any situation in which a runner on a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball that is if the ball is caught he can tag up and run or decide to stay and if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time .,0

before i begin lambasting don cherry let me first say that i ve been sort of a cherry fan for a while admittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly but he s more or less harmless on saturday however he crossed the lines of good taste this is the best he can do gee don tremendous amounts of professionalism here the cbc looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with this nonsense making fun of names it s bad enough that he makes asinine blanket statements about european players but he s now resorted to making fun of their names too he sounded like an idiot much like he did last week when he said that teemu would never make it to his rock em sock em video until he dropped the gloves well what he _ said _ was that even though he s been around the league for quite some time he still does n t know who s where w r t conference and division names hello mcfly the names have been around for a couple of decades or so he also invited the audience to name the teams in the wales quick quick followed by ah you do n t know i do n t know sorry don wrong on this one this was absolutely hilarious don s argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly good unfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in the nba case serious money oh well he s never been one for objectivity has he don s question to gretzky :,1

how do you figure that when bryan murray took over the wings they were a pretty good team that was contending for the stanley cup but looked unlikely to win it now they are a pretty good team that is contending for the stanley cup but looks unlikely to win it a truly great gm would have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon of the nhl and maybe win the stanley cup a good gm like murray can maintain the team s success but ca n t push them to the next level in the history of hockey there have been several better gm s than murray way too many to name murray is n t even the best gm in the league today he fails in comparison to sinden sather savard caron fletcher and quinn in my estimation i ca n t imagine how bryan murray can be the best gm anyone has ever seen in hockey unless they have seen very few gm s .,1

i think the three headed gm s guiding principle was to keep veterans in favor of youngsters only if they offered a significant advantage at the end of last season the contracts of several veterans with somewhat maginal contributions fenton bozek anderson and a couple others i ca n t remember were bought out the idea was that youngsters could play almost as well and had the potential to improve where these older guys did not and they traded mullen because he wanted to go not because he was n t good enough but i think they were a bit too optimistic in thinking they could make up for his contributions an example from this season skriko was brought in on a trial basis but not kept because of his age i thought he was a decent contributor worth keeping around the youth movement has its advantages look at gaudreau who might still be in kc if more veterans had been kept around but you have to find the right balance .,1

funny you should mention it this is exactly the case i was going to make i will grant that a star like mario will draw fans even if the team sucks but this is short term only i still do not think the attendance increase will last unless the team is a winning competitive improving butt kicking one pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support them if they suddenly dropped to say qqq points you d have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon ok my numbers came from the nhl guide and record book you can give the credit to mario since he deserves it but my point is that it was n t mario himself but it was the expectation of things to come i e a winning team that he created by being the next great hockey superstar and before anybody jumps in and says i m nit picking and mincing words go back and read from where this thread started it might help to think about what would go through a fan s mind who suddenly found an interest in mario and the pens was it gee mario lemieux is amazing i ll go watch him play or was it gee now we ve got a kick ass guy on our side i ll go watch him play i think it was the latter i do n t think this is accurate the tickets sell but people do n t go to the games i think this thread has already been discussed season ticket holders in la do n t always use their tickets so in effect after the kings initial success following gretzky s arrival qqq to qqq points same source and corresponding attendance jump there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much whether or not the kings are a winner is debatable i claim that since gretzky s arrival they have at the very least been competitive i also claim that mcnall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the oiler dynasty but that s another story and included only because i do n t like mcnall anyway mcnall did do some heavy marketing around gretzky and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales etc but as i said when the kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the forum even if the tickets were sold for the short term imo although i think that it s inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as lemieux or gretzky simply because they make people around them better well at least we are in full agreement here so are you saying roger has ever had a valid point could n t resist yes but they are doing no worse than last year i think the same type of reasoning i applied to a new pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at winnipeg games it s difficult to predict but do you think that if the jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels i seriously doubt it because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone with or without selanne .,1

stuff deleted i think this goes along with a comment you made in an earlier post namely quinn taking advantage of a major league bonehead for a gm in st louis this trade was an absolutely stupid trade for st louis and it was not the only stupid trade that this guy made we can give quinn credit for being an opportunist here stuff about other trades deleted how do you figure both vancouver and detroit did the same thing last year they both won their division they had close to the same number of points they both went down qqq qqq in the first round of the playoffs before finally escaping in qqq games and they both got knocked out in the second round by teams they should have been able to beat with less talent specifically if i remember correctly third place teams how does this make vancouver more improved further if i m not mistaken the wings had more points than vancouver at the end of this season albeit not many .,1
not particularly in the world series during the season he was probably more valuable than say putting olerud out there to pitch but yeah he was valuable in getting them there in the postseason he sucked dirty canal water through a straw the jays won in spite of morris much more than because of him umm roger return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago where the poster valentine was replying to used of ws rings as a measure of better the concept is called context and you should really become familiar with it someday unless this transaltes to clemens has n t gone into lou gorman s office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he d been traded to the jays i m at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it what on earth does this mean over their careers clemens has won qqq of the games he s started morris qqq per year clemens has averaged nearly qqq wins morris just under qqq would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning a game if so then consider that clemens allows qqq qqq innings pitched morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings in fact jack morris has never in his career had an era for a single year as good as clemens career era but i forget in the maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to buckner missing that grounder in qqq had morris been on the sox it would have been a routine groundout right speaking of stupid it has been patiently and not so patiently explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask no one is crying the jays won and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the al east they performed well in two short series and won the world series and i congratulate them for it as a red sox fan i hope they keep morris i was happy when they picked up stewart and elated when they traded for darrin jackson you see unless you believe in some mystical link between morris and the offense you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky luck runs out just like it did in qqq when he pitched qqq more innings than qqq gave up exactly one earned run more than in qqq and went qqq qqq seriously roger i d really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the qqq morris and the qqq morris which one was a better pitcher and why did morris somehow learn how to win in the intervening ten years if so then why did he go qqq qqq in qqq with minnesota with an era over half a run lower than qqq mike jones aix high end development mjones donald aix kingston ibm com,0

ruotsaleinen was a more than competent nhl er his choice of where to play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability he was crucial to the oilers stanley cup victory in qqq the one without gretzky because he made an oiler power play which was lethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive the oilers missed him more the following year than kurri and i think the oilers would have make the finals if ruotsaleinen has stayed around the following season and would have beaten pittsburgh with ruotsaleinen and a healthy messier and delayed pittsburgh s dynasty by a season .,1

as long as a player is under contract to an organization he is obligated to play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission to play the rangers are certainly within their rights to force zubov and andersson to report to binghampton it certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the ranger organization however is having binghampton win the calder cup really more important to them than keeping their players happy ?,1

much text deleted plus minus it is the most misleading hockey stat available not necessarily the most misleading but you are right it definitely needs to be taken in the proper perspective a shining example is if you look at the penguins individual you will find very few minuses that only makes common sense since they did n t lose many games until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice time per game and some measure of its quality i e is the player put out in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up against the other team s top one or two lines short handed etc i would much rather see the disappear altogether instead of having its dubious merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications unfortunately you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to really come up with a statistic which really shows a player s value let s just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it like i m doing now excuse me ),1

well it seems that the habs have been much talked about of late so here s my qqq these guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the damn net watch them in the offensive zone especially on the powerplay damphousse or lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone maybe pass to the point get it back skate some more pass it around but where s the shot answer the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands in front of the net a la neely shanahan tocchet etc etc too bad demers wo n t put dipietro or leclair on the powerplay more often dammit even ewen would at least cause some disruptions montreal desperately needs a power forward with some talent imo then watch them in their own zone patrick roy is screened on everything say what you want about his performance imnsho he can not stop what he can not see and montreal s defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net last night against washington roy played a great game the first goal came on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble i ve seen in a long time and he did n t have a hope in hell of stopping the shot the second goal came on a deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway pathetic defence the third goal was en no wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen .,1

let s look at the effects of inflation on qqq s superstars salaries i read once that the babe made qqq one year and that was about as good as it got for him let s assume he made that in qqq i m not sure of the figures but i know i m in the ballpark pun intended today assuming a qqq yearly inflation rate which is an understatement if not accurate his measly qqq salary would be worth fv qqq x qqq qqq qqq qqq x qqq just over qqq assuming inflation is average of around qqq fv qqq x qqq qqq almost qqq i did n t crunch these numbers beforehand these numbers might lead one to believe that today s players are slightly overpaid the babe appears to have made then what today s average to above average players make now perfectly accurate salary year of salary and average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate but i don t think i m off by much chop chop michael mule ',0

quoted for future reference he believed one of two things qqq sabo was more likely than samuel to get a hit or qqq that more good would be done in the long run by leaving sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome in fact you do n t know what perez had in mind when he left sabo in in fact i do n t think anyone is claiming that they can predict the future or any particular future event but we can believe that certain trends are due to a cause whether or not we have identified the cause and therefore will continue i think seeing insults in other people s opinions is kind of silly after all mark did n t call you a total idiot or call your work stupid he simply stated that it did n t change his opinion on the subject if player a hits better on tuesdays and always has and mark believes that it might be an indication that he will hit on tuesday better next season as well would you respond the same way at some point you might admit that all variable might not be known to you who knows what this guy does every monday night maybe he sees his sports shrink on tuesday mornings or has his vitamin b shots monday nights but this is something that s true of one guy only it does n t mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire league by days of the week nor that there should be but it does n t mean we ca n t make predictions based on that for that particular player i only see a prediction for one player here i do n t see anything about all batters that s exactly what mark is trying to do though find hitters that have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions for these hitters based on their past performance huh what does gambler s fallacy have to do with anything whether you can know the reason for correlation or not you ca n t deny that it has existent you can only make an argument that you do n t think it is likely to continue to exist because you ca n t see a reason for it to exist someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate the argument along the lines of star player with l r splits will always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game i e opposing manager will always bring in a ah pitcher to face him where his manager will not pull him for a ph what about you if the shoe fits will you wear it with an open mind ?,0
i believe that phil esposito was the first to wear qqq when he played with the rangers in the qqq this was the season that they put the rangers crest and modern style numbers on the jerseys instead of the new york or rangers block letters and two colour numbers he took qqq because the rangers already had a qqq hockey night in canada made a big thing out of it saying it was the biggest uniform style change in a long time this was before pittsburgh and vancouver changed their colours dwarf,1

i agree and disagree john is saying that the batters efforts will result in qqq more wins then losses while you are probably correct that qqq does not mean qqq more wins then losses it means something i would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by qqq in each of qqq pas then i would a player who increased my chances of winning by qqq in each of qqq pas thus there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between john s statistic and winning games thus before you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is the only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has first we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game second remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning that is a player who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases thus i m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to qqq in that game sometimes they will add up to more then one sometime less than one also the pitchers bad performances giving up qqq runs may have given them a large negative percentage for that game also any batter that pulled an qqq qqq night would give large negatives no but really only because you have a smaller sample size i would think however that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning and realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation not a blow out it is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning look a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games on the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win the offence has many more outs to do something about but i am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either if i am down qqq runs in the ninth it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth no but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be qqq before the possesion in which the free throws were made look if you are down qqq point with qqq seconds left there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball and do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers fouls bad defense etc caused a negative chance that the team would win from reading all of the discussion on this statistic i feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda at first look this statistic valadates clutchness but it really does not cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down i ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens so if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that except for a lot of noice this statistic has a positive association to player performance there is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness certainly we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example we may find for instance that a home run increases your chance of winning by qqq on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by qqq i bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses how do we evaluate relief pitchers say john and sam have the exact same pitching statistics runs earned runs k s bb s etc both had exceptional numbers john however only pitched in closer situations while sam was a mop up man who was more valuble to their team probably john who was the better pitcher they were probably about the same .,0
bleep bleep bleep the bruins lost again in o t i ca n t stand it aside from frustrated ravings i must give buffalo credit they are making good on most of their scoring opportunities and are playing great defense boston players ca n t seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the buffalo net except for on rare occasions the buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but he s also getting plenty of help boston has been playing rather well better than would be indicated by the series score of qqq qqq but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the game as a result boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the qqq period qqq goals down this must stop if boston is to have any hope of winning a single game the outlook for the bruin s advancement to the second round are quite bleak imho the bruins need to score first if they can do that they have an excellent chance of winning since they have outplayed the sabres in the qqq and qqq periods the scary thing is that i ll be going to grad school in buffalo next year i ll never cheer for the sabres you ca n t convert me qqq,1
i thought bill james latest book completely and totally sucked i bought it but will not purchase anything of his ever again without thoroughly looking at it first what tripe the book is inconsistent and filled with selective analysis james claims to be looking forward and then makes some absolutely bizarre statements of value not only that but i got the impression he probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name on it to say i was disappointed is a grand understatement .,0
snip stats deleted we ve all seen them by now i nominate this last bit for anti stathead quote of the week alomar only has a qqq point advantage in the most important offensive category while baerga who studied in the joe carter school of out burning has more impressive mediot stats largely due to opportunities rather than quality the lines are fairly close in value but edge to alomar now baerga ai n t chopped liver but alomar is still the man to beat among al second basemen craig,0
i loved dan kelly he was on usa when i first got hooked on hockey back in qqq or so no he was n t always spot on top of the play and he was n t overly cute but those pipes that lusty barrel chested voice no pipsqueak was he unlike some fellas we know i rode into hockey mania on the coattails of gretzky and the boys on the bus my first finals saw the islanders sweep them but i ll never forget the night a year later when the oilers closed it out at home in the pandemonium the smoke from a million sparklers the long empty net goal near the end and dan kelly letting the crowd s reaction tell the story for a few long seconds then that voice barking through the din dave lumley sews it up for edmonton it sounds stupid but that early for me hockey memory will always bring a thrill since then i ve grown a lot more jaded about the game but i was really saddened by dan kelly s passing he was one of the good guys .,1
the leafs have always been kind of comical during the second imlach era when darryl sittler was called a cancer on the team he tore the c off his sweater and for a while the leafs did n t have a captain sittler eventually ended up in philly and he was promised the philly captaincy by new gm and sittler s friend bobby clarke instead sittler got traded to detroit rick vaive was the leaf captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him then he was traded to chicago during doug carpenter s tenure as leaf coach in an attempt to kiss the ass of a sulking gary leeman the leafs took the a away from brad marsh to give to leeman leeman would n t take it and when they tried to give it back to marsh he would n t take it neither the best story i remember about a captain concerned mel bridgman late of the senators while he was in philadelphia bobby clarke arguably one of the great captains of all time was bumped up to the status of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy bridgman be came the new captain a reporter asked a flyer what bridgman did as a captain since clarke was still the undisputed leader amongst the players the reporter was told that bridgman was in charge of making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full -,1
i ve been a giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained about the old ballyard place sure it s been cold the food lines were long and the hired hands were surly but this was all part of the giants mystique or so i thought i went to tuesday s game qqq qqq giants over the marlins and the stick was a much different place nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind but everything is a lot better the lines are a lot shorter the bathrooms are clean and have running water and the hired hands were very polite the new foghorn lights up and blows after each homerun and the wooden fence are very nice as are the new bleachers the bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view and they ve got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers the only complaint is that the electronic old fashioned scoreboard looks electronic could be better these things should have been done a long time ago but it took a real businessman ex safeway president peter magowan to figure it out just like he used to tell his checkers if the customers do n t come back i do n t need as many checkers this is n t a knock on bob lurie he was a competent businessman but he did n t deal much with the general public i ll give an example of how the level of service has changed the onion dispenser jammed as i was using it an attendant came over apoligized for the problem and proceeded to fix the machine after he was done he cleaned the machine and said he was glad to be able to help in the old days there was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say go to the stand qqq feet away they might be able to help all in all it was a fun day,0

well here in detroit we get to see and hear don cherry quite regularly the detroit area picks up hockey night in canada from cbc ch qqq in windsor where we see don cherry s coaches corner between periods we also get to see don cherry s grapevine just before the game the grapevine is a hockey talk show where don talks to a player or coach about what else hockey it s actually a pretty good show and don is n t as annoying as he is on coaches corner i think this is were don got his nickname grapes but i m not sure don use to coach the boston bruins i do n t know exactly when that was could someone fill me in on this info a local radio station here in detroit wllz talks to don every tuesday morning personally i ve had my fill of donny he really pisses me off sometimes during the detroit toronto game monday night on cbc don gave high praise to doug gilmour saying he was a two way player and not just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player in the game because of that that s fine and i agree that gilmour is a good two way player but he said the exact same thing about yzerman about a month ago on a local radio talk show what gives it seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from city to city don cherry i think insert star player name for city that he is in is the best two way player in the league today there have been other times ca n t remember exactly what he said that he basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to someone here on the net said something about how don criticized mario lemieux but when the time comes for don to broadcast the cup playoffs from the civic center yes i think the pens will make it out of the wales conference don will apologize left and right for his remarks about lemieux in my opinion he is an ass and i wo n t change my opinion if i m in a different city sorry if this did n t answer your question better but i just had to get this off my chest .,1

wales conference adams division semifinal i m hoping for a fuhr miracle but i agree that boston will likely win the series goaltending is about equal top offensive players are about equal mogilny lafontaine vs oates juneau but buffalo has no answer to neely not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player btw in fact he s one of my favourites even though he s a damn bruin and the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway but i think it will go six agreed here but montreal will be pushed to the limit is it just me or does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy go habs final i ca n t predict a montreal victory because i ve been watching them play for qqq weeks and imo they severly need some tougher players especially to play in the garden last time they beat the b s qqq qqq but boston had a clear territorial advantage the victory was roy s at the same time i ca n t bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so i ll just say i will not be putting money on this series agreed ny does n t have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year pens in five which is credit to ny agreed here too but i think it will go at least six jersey has a decent team and washington has done poorly against the division this year i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled i do n t think it will go six either maybe five if pittsburgh plays boston imo they win in likely five possibly six they own the bruins if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once again i wo n t be putting money on the seventh game i say seven because the habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season chicago will win but i think in at least six chicago is not that good imo and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties very true the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs toronto might win two or three at mlg though wings in six maybe even seven it _ will _ be a war possibly the most intense playoff series of them all and yes i think detroit will win probert will have to come up big though our first disagreement canucks are playing like shit they do n t use their size at all which may explain why they get hammered qqq qqq by a team chasing them calgary winnipeg in six this is also tough for me to call because i have n t seen the smythe enough i do n t think roberts will be well enough to figure in coffey is a non issue who cares what carson has done before and never underestimate gretzky la in six if it is these two calgary will not need six games but i think it will be la winnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice wow must ve been tough to go against your team but let s see i picked la detroit detroit will win probably in six if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and i would n t bet against the wings they are very strong imo and nobody knows how strong because they ve been underachieving most of the year if forced to choose though i d have to take the penguins a side note vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than gilmour no way he is a more talented pure goal scorer but aside from the age difference there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team i m not asking for flames either btw i ve spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he s a great player but while he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively give teemu an edge gilmour does it all i know a lot of gilmour bashing goes on esp from flame fans but imo you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill he is easily one of the best all round players in the nhl .,1

we have no way of knowing because we can not separate morris contribu tion from the rest of the team s there is only one way of determin ing best in baseball and that is by looking at the scoreboard at the end of the game each game determines which team is the best that day at the end of the season the team that was the best the most often is the best in the division the playoffs determine the best of the best but the point is that the only decision making pro cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re lates to the teams not the individual players there is no method inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances and that is how it should be because after all baseball is a team game to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab solutely that player a s team would have played better with player b in their lineup sheer speculation impossible to ascertain if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has done better with those statistics as a criteria then fine but you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individual s contribution to winning the ws because that is the only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of base ball so until you can prove that clemens contributes to a ws cham pionship more than morris your evaluation of clemens is totally sub jective and is mere opinion i have yet to see that any of you can predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon exactly the jays won with morris pitching and boston wins with clemens pitching i am not saying that morris is better than clemens i am saying that individual comparisons between players are totally meaningless and that anyone claiming that clemens is better based on his era has missed the point of what baseball is all about you do n t have to be rude for you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of my argument or you yourself have committed a fallacy ignoratio elenchi i am not saying that morris is better than clemens because he has more rings although i have tongue in cheek claimed that in the past i am saying that it is impossible to isolate an individual s performance from that of his team s for the purpose of comparing that individual s performance with another individual s per formance the stats are a nice hobby and that s about it there is no new knowledge being produced so when a poster claims that morris is better than clemens because he has more rings the poster is no more nor less incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds -,0
just a little something i found while reading the village voice which is not noted for its sports coverage but occasionally the print some interesting features this year the predictions team analyses for the qqq season were presented in the form of bob dylan lyrics i do n t have the article in front of me so i ll only give the memorable ones here that i remember and know the melody to i could dig up more if there is interest yankess to the tune of subterranean homesick blues howe is in the basement mixing up the medicine george is on the pavement thinking bout the government wade boggs in a trench coat bat out paid off says he s got a bad back wants to get it laid off look out kids it s somethin you did do n t know when but it s columbus again mets to the tune of like a rolling stone once upon a time you played so fine you threw away dykstra before his prime did n t you people said beware cone he s bound to roam but you thought they were just kidding you you used to laugh about the strawberry that was headin out but now you do n t talk so loud now you do n t seem so proud about having to shop vince coleman for your next deal phillies to the tune of highway qqq well daulton and dykstra should have some fun just keep them off of highway qqq giants to the tune of the ballad of rubin hurricane carter ),0

up to this point i really thought this had been written by a pro sdcn anti mediot poster blessed with a certain talent for sarcasm and biting remarks somebody like me for instance the lurid overstatements were obviously intended to humiliate the original poster but then the scales were lifted from my eyes looks like robert is really being serious oh well i compare the performance of the qqq phillies with the qqq edition which had outstanding run producers at every position except ss yet finished at a frustrating qqq level the qqq folks did n t ever amount to anything and neither will the qqq squad imho any other parallels with previous years teams for this year s editions in the style of qqq braves qqq orioles greg mockingbird franklin interracial mixing encompasses a lot lot more qqq than mingling between qqq races robohen,0

speaking of paddock what s he doing slagging sandlak if sandlak puts his mind to it he can be a physical presence and waking him up might be a real mistake is n t sandbag out with an injury now anyways perhaps paddock meant to say that momesso was the cheap short artist after all that would make more sense .,1
however batters did n t use to go for strolls after bad calls to the degree they do now everyone was told of the new emphasis on speeding up games the rule that hirschbeck invoked has been in the books a long time nobody including hirschbeck ever said he was that s your perhaps colored by your partisanship of the braves perception hirschbeck s view was that gant was heading off for a long walk and in accordance with his instructions concerning speeding games up directed him into the batter s box the point is based on the rulebook and the umpires instructions it was not an unreasonable request the braves were already upset had gant done as instructed you would n t have remembered the name of the umpire .,0
hmmm what about walks and sb baerga got clobbered by alomar in obp and beat him in slg by a lesser margin even putting aside any other factors a player with a qqq point edge in obp is more productive than a player with a qqq point edge in slg the issue has been studied before and i doubt you could come up with any convincing argument the other way people see the batting average and the hr but they do n t really know their value is worth unless they ve studied the issue closely the fact is that baerga ate up a lot more outs than alomar while baerga was making outs alomar was drawing walks and being on base for carter winfield et al .,0

i agree i ll delete more as well still if the whispers reached san francisco it is certainly possible they were stronger elsewhere also it was teammates making the aspersions in any event i know of no other player to be maligned in the last couple years uh the original author s point was that black and white players were por trayed differently by the media and towards this he gave a highly selected list to prove his case sanders name showed up eventually i dispute that sanders has ever been called lazy by the media uh that poster specifically stated allow me to be the first it is not a quibble then to state that the media did not portray canseco as being lazy if the other person chooses to so accuse him after my post that does not make it a quibble and in fact the media around here tend ed to play up his time in the wieght room hardly lazy and hardly a quibble have you ever seen any mediot portray canseco as lazy unconcerned with his fielding yes lazy no well canseco has been involved in several felonies including his high speed record carrying concealed fire arms and of course the domestic violence clemens had a run in at a bar canseco had that as well and in both cases the coverage was relatively minimal uh if the only evidence offered is anecdotal how can it be objected that the counter to it is also anecdotal uh yes and i agree with your assesment of boggs rather specifically however you did say everybody who has ever won a batting title has been accused of selfishness i have not ever anywhere heard this said of puckett pendleton either similarly brett b williams and others there are others perhaps they are simply not as outspoken except in the case of the born again types i mention .,0

what is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus wc i know that the rangers are holding back kovalev zubov and andersson for binghamton but i also know that the whalers wanted michael nylander to play for springfield while nylander wanted to play for sweden the whalers allowed the nhl to decide and the nhl chose the wcs how does this differ from the rangers and oilers did the whalers have to go through the league or could they have forced nylander to play in springfield ?,1
i heard that eli is selling the team to a group in cinninati this would help so that the o s could make some real free agent signings in the offseason training camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now the backup catcher postion will be a showdown between tackett and parent although i would prefer parent qqq draft pick jeff hammonds may be coming up faster in the o s hierarchy of the minors faster than expected mike flanagan is trying for another comeback big ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half this may be ben s year i feel that while this may not be mussina s cy young year he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around august i really hope baines can provide the rf support the o s need orsulak was decent but i had hoped that chito martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in qqq the o s right now do n t have many left handed hitters anderson proving last year was no fluke and cal s return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant the rotation should be sutcliffe mussina mcdonald rhodes olson is an interesting case will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs you never know the way i see the al east this year with personal biases mixed in baltimore new york toronto milwaukee cleveland boston detroit the top qqq are the only true contenders in my mind one of these qqq will definitely win the division unless it snows in hell maryland i feel that this baltimore s season to finally put everything together _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ~,0

no and in fact that was ferreira s original strategy which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement there was n t exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted something people seem to forget the only real question is whether they did it as well as ferreira could have if he stayed or whether the basic strategy was flawed since ferreira has been quoated as saying he s going to do something different in anaheim with the ducks my guess is that it was n t as good in practice as it was on paper and he s tweaking it a bit second time around one also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we had n t had those injuries and whether we re complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar let s also not forget that ferreira came this close to trading kelly kisio which if the rumors i ve heard are true was over the strong objections of other aspects of shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three headed consensus oriented gm imagine for a second where the sharks would be today if that fax machine had n t jammed especially an unhappy player that is n t playing as well because of it not that i d accuse mullen of tanking but his motivation simply was n t there and that kind of thing can affect the team exactly at the time they let skriko go we had n t yet had the major injury bugs that killed us later i d much rather have skriko around than someone like dean kolstad but at that point that was n t the choice and since the choice was more one of skriko vs someone like john carter i think the right choice was made for that time period .,1

most of this discussion has been between mark singer and david tate with valentine weighing in on the same side as dave at various times my opinion fwiw to all mark age does n t matter ability does i would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best i do n t care if he is qqq if he plays better than what i have i want him out there sandy alomar had decent minor league numbers grossly inflated by the pcl in general and las vegas in particular he should have been projected as an average major league hitter which is good for a catcher i ll admit santiago s numbers would probably come out the same as sandy s but i do n t have the league data from the qqq to check it out that being said i agree with sending lopez to richmond at least to start the season as the box below shows he has one minor league season in which he hit well he has two in which he hit very very poorly i want to see that the qqq lopez is real olson and berryhill are not complete mediocrities for catchers especially nl catchers they are essentially average hitters with equivalent averages around qqq if he had hit well at prior levels i would say he belongs on the braves but there is a reasonable chance that lopez last year was just as much a fluke as alomar in qqq or santiago in qqq one year at any level at any age does n t satisfy my standards of evidence javier lopez qqq qqq bur qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq dur qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq grn qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq atl qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq maj qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq min qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq tot qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq maj qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq min qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq tot qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq on a similar note i do n t understand why more people are not supportive of neon deion granted i thought his behavior with mccarver last year was completely bush last year was the first time he ever got qqq ab in one place so his lines are hard to read but he has a combined qqq ops in minor league play with his speed is more valuable than the ops alone indicates and at a still young age qqq had a monster year with an qqq ops he has a total major and minor eqa of qqq above major league average and above average for cf which was about qqq in the nl last year he has shown at least the potential of going into the qqq which would make him one of the qqq best hitters in the league he has two full seasons before reaching his prime season of qqq he should be considered as a legitimate prospect and not as a simple side show attraction deion sanders qqq qqq fla qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq int qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq eas qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq nyy qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq int qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq nyy qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq int qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq atl qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq ric qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq atl qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq maj qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq min qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq tot qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq maj qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq min qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq tot qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq,0

how about kevin hatcher scored roughly qqq goals plays qqq minutes a game that s really sad when two second rate goalies barasso and belfour are the main contenders for the vezina call me crazy but how about tommy soderstrom five shutouts for a qqq place team that does n t really play defense it s really unfortunate that the better goalies in the league mclean essensa vernon had unspectacular years btw if you are going to award the norris on the basis of the last qqq days why not give the vezina to moog he has been the best goalie over the past month arbour or king burns will probably win since playoffs are n t taken into consideration he s ok in the regular season but i m not sure if he s beaten anyone other than hartford in the playoffs .,1
well then given your definition of best is it not conceivable that alfredo griffin could bring something to a team that that team needs to win while larkin might not have that something the team needs would griffin then be better than larkin no i am not trying to define the quality of an individual at least not for the purpose of ranking them toronto won with olerud they might have won with fielder they might not have won with thomas detroit might have won with thomas chicago might have won with fielder you ca n t rank these individuals you can only look at who might contribute more to the team effort which is winning the ws thomas could not have contributed to that goal any more than olerud so i can not say that olerud is less of a player -,0

umpires are not required to call time out just because a player asks for time only in extreme cases like dust in the pitcher s or hitter s eyes should an umpire call time the batter has qqq seconds to get situated in the box and receive a pitch i m against putting a giant clock or any size clock for that matter up to count down qqq seconds between pitches and the minute for warm ups but i think umpires should tell hitters to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever and instruct the pitcher to pitch the same goes for pitchers umps should tell them to pitch or feint within qqq seconds or a ball will be called that s the way it should be ryan robbins penobscot hall university of maine,0

as far as i know toronto pittsburgh and new york nl change their uniforms every year every other year e g new york it will say mets in cursive new york in cursive or new york in all caps minor changes but they do change them often last year i think they had new york in all caps did toronto have blue jays or toronto last year what about pittsburgh i hate the gray they should opt for more color like the white sox i hate white team versus gray team spring training uniforms look much better .,0

norman green claims that he has lost money over the last three years that he has owned the team when he bought the team it seemed kind of obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red before the team started making a profit again he gave the impression that he was willing to do so he claimed two years ago that the team needed to average only qqq fans per game in order to pull a profit but this season the team averaged qqq fans despite increasd ticket prices i think the team s attendence and play was clearly in an upward trend which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in deciding to move he was even offered the many concessions he rudely demanded such as guaranteed season ticket sales cheap rent at the other two arenas in town etc oh well i guess the bottom line is green wanted immediate huge returns in dallas and was n t willing to wait another year or so in mn dallas gave green a pretty stellar deal to play there although i feel minnesota s was quite reasonable and he also has some cronies down there as well all this means is that minnesota is without an nhl team for a year or two too bad for the nhl .,1
i was thinking about who on each of the teams were the mvps biggest surprises and biggest disappointments this year now these are just my observations and are admittedly lacking because i have not had an opportunity to see all the teams the same amount anyway mvp most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and in terms of leadership ca n t win without him biggest surprise the player who rose above expectation the player that may have raised the level of his game to a new height even if that new level does n t necessarily warrant an allstar berth includes those players who at the outset of the season may not even have been in the team s plans biggest disappointment the player from whom we expected more e g i picked denis savard in montreal because with the new emphasis on offence brought by demers should n t savard have done better team biggest biggest team mvp surprise disappointment boston bruins oates d sweeney wesley buffalo sabres lafontaine mogilny audette jinx calgary flames roberts reichel petit chicago blackhawks roenick ruuttu goulet detroit red wings yzerman chaisson kozlov edmonton oilers manson buchberger mellanby hartford whalers sanderson cassells corriveau los angeles kings robitaille donnelly hrudey minnesota north stars modano tinordi not expected back broten montreal canadiens muller lebeau savard new jersey devils stevens semak maclean new york islanders turgeon king finally marois new york rangers messier kovalev bourque ottawa senators maciver baker jelinek philadelphia flyers lindros recchi fedyk galley eklund pittsburgh penguins lemieux tocchet even for him jagr quebec nordiques sakic ricci kovalenko pearson san jose sharks kisio gaudreau maley st louis blues shanahan c joseph ron sutter tampa bay lightening bradley bradley creighton kasper toronto maple leafs gilmour potvin ellett anderson vancouver canucks bure nedved finally momesso washington capitals hatcher bondra cote elynuik winnipeg jets selanne selanne druce as i mentioned up top these are my impressions from where i sit i would welcome any opinions from those fans nearer their teams in other words anywhere away from a toronto newspaper ),1
the overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the quebec defender who deflected the puck the re play officials did not take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first non goal so it seemed pretty non controversial i agree that it was a great game good to see roy and damphousse back into form hopefully the sign of good things to come .,1

wait a minute if i read the rules right a stike is any portion of the ball over any portion of the plate given that the ball is qqq in diameter this sez that the zone width is qqq qqq qqq or qqq while this is still less than the qqq number given i can forgive any ump for misjudging qqq on an object moving at qqq to qqq miles per hour many times not in a straight line i think the umpires union has a great grasp of the rules !,0

attn those who live inthe philadelphia metro area back in september i was listening to wip and i remember the morning guys were talking with mayor ed rendell the topic of conversation was a new ball park for the phillies the location for this new park was suggested to be near qqq st station at the time the mayor was optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality has there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream i know the city of philadelphia has other projects ahead such as the new convention center and the upcoming spectrum ii but it would be nice to see this a reality it is planned that the phillies leave the vet and leave it solely to the eagles and if that s the case the eagles should make the vet a grass stadium but that s another story i want to see that day !,0
linares has not defected as i pointed out mlb requires that the player defect first what a surprise as long as the pool of talent is not accessible to all teams mlb wo n t let a few teams sign it seems perfectly reasonable to me except that mlb wo n t allow it which is all i ever said .,1

during the regular season when the intensity is down not many teams have forwards who will continually go and park themselves in front of the opposing teams net and the inadequacy of the leafs defense in this regard thus did n t matter however the playoffs are a different story every good team is going to have players who are going to become potted plants in front of potvin and the leafs relatively unphysical defensive core will finally be exposed as weak an inept hard work will go a long way during the regular season almost to qqq points and the leafs deserve credit for that but in the playoffs talent matters because everyone begins working hard .,1
argument over reasonable players and umpires deleted yes but the baseball rules say you can only appeal a ball and not a strike there was no decision made by the umpire regarding an appeal once he called it a strike the call could not be changed i thought that the umpire did the right thing .,0

looks like bob errey s ring really sparkles in that locker room and everyone else wants one too correct me if i m wrong though just through the net not through e mail i do n t need qqq rl s in my e mail but was n t boston down qqq qqq vs buffalo last year boston lost qqq and qqq at home and won qqq and qqq in buffalo whoever wins game qqq will advance simple as that ),1
it took three days to get to us but i ll try anyway as i naturally have n t seen the answer safe the correct call is infield fly batter out if fair runners may advance at own risk got ta tag up if caught etc it is not a force and the pop was not caught so regardless of whether the ss tags qqq or qqq it was n t clear above he has n t got the runner out out see rule qqq approved ruling below in this case the umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule does n t apply sounds like a bad call here but that s not the point the batter is not out so a force situation is created therefore the runner is out unless by rule qqq the ball is dead and the batter is safe then i guess the runners would advance unmolested i ca n t really tell from qqq that the ball is dead in this situation pertinent rules qqq definition of infield fly when an infield fly is called runners may advance at their own risk if on an infield fly rule the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball the ball remains in play despite the provisions of rule qqq the infield fly rule takes precedence qqq a batter is out when an infielder intentionally drops a fair fly ball or line drive with first first and second first and thrid or first second and third base occupied before two are out the ball is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base or bases approved ruling in this situation the batter is not out if the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground except when the infield fly rule applies .,0
really what makes you think the islanders have a better shot they could n t even beat the whalers in two games well since you re a pens fans the whole question is moot i think the teams most likely to beat the pens are the bruins nordiques and blackhawks but i do n t think they can really do it ),1

perhaps it was trottier it happened behind the habs goal if i recall gainey simply did n t have his head up as he was picking up the puck if gilmour was taken completely by surprise as gainey was then yeah i would have to say that doug was n t playing technically smart hockey in any case to claim as greg did that gainey never made a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous good for you you d only be displaying your ignorance of course but to each his own i think gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at all certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team and that is simply because there are not enough solid two way players to go around who would you rather have as your checking centre doug gilmour or doug jarvis for that matter i would take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres do you think gretzky could cover bob gainey you re wrong again the selke is awarded to the forward that does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger if gilmour does the best defensive job in the league i do n t see why he should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen sively settle down if you think that i have likened the selke to the nobel prize then i suggest that you had best settle down and if you are going to try to put words in my mouth let me suggest that you settle down before you bother following up on my postings you might consider developing your own style after all imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and i am quite sure that flattery is not your intention cordially as always rm,1
so done career velarde has n t been to columbus if i recall for about three years granted he has n t been a full time player but when he does play i ve always thought he had a good bat he might be demoralized about not playing full time but he has n t been shuttled around i think he s been in new york ever since he had qqq hits in qqq ab back in qqq or qqq i believe i do n t think he is gold glove calibre but he does n t boot it around either i think if velarde is given a chance he could become extremely productive i do n t have any stats to back this up and i do n t know if his defense would cost any games but i think he could help and he has this year he has qqq hr already same goes for jim leyrtiz he has a big mouth but he does get the job done when he concentrates i think the situation with leyritz is that he believes he is a potential super star and he gets pissed about not playing i think he might have realized something when the marlins or rockies did n t select him the yanks need to worry about the bullpen right now kamieniecki and wickman militello in the bullpen ouch i m praying that the bp will return to last year s form .,0

since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx qqq posts going back to the braves could be better off if an injury happens i may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame qqq back at the beginning of spring training i though lopez would make the squad easily olson was still recovering from his late season injury knee i believe and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before june and then berryhill was dinged up i was looking forward to this because i believe that lopez can hit and field the position before last season he was the braves defensive catcher prospect while brian deak was the braves offensive catcher prospect besides olson and berryhill could n t hit their way out of a wet cardboard box and do n t walk enough to be useful but olson recovered quickly berryhill recovered and the braves went with the two vets i still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season he would n t have gotten his job back qqq there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around after all ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear there are teams out there without one average ml catcher california and seattle come to mind certainly trying to move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work plus you d have to eat that salary which is n t huge but is n t tiddleywinks either i think olson s at about qqq berryhill at qqq but that s only what i recall qqq yes i think arbitration eligibility may have a role to play in this also what is it that qqq of the qqq players are n t eligible for arbitration only the qqq that were on the roster the longest are eligible of course the system may change but the extent of that change is not yet known from a business standpoint it may make sense to keep lopez down until june the first time olson berryhill go on the dl qqq i am still disappointed that lopez is n t on the team i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves and the truth is that i d rather see our best team on the field which imo includes lopez of course today we play the cubs hopefully we wo n t need him as for the schuerholz cox conversation i imagine it went like this remember they ve both been gm s the following is not meant to be read by the humor impaired cox ok we ve sent jones down his fielding could be a little smoother besides blauser can hit ok and his fielding is better than it used to be schuerholz well we ll have to send nieves down too deion just wo n t sign that baseball only contract we ca n t count on him in october so we have to keep nixon around for the defense besides gorman s not ready to give up on billy hatcher yet once hatcher s gone and deion signs we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez that ought to give us some pitching depth in qqq cox yep that ll be nice too bad deion wo n t sign ok i ll look for nieves when justice starts having berry berry er back problems again now what about klesko schuerholz well we ve still got to fork out another qqq mil for bream if we keep klesko we either lose the money or cabrera i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell but somehow he does n t seem to be the same gm first jeffries for jose and now whiten for clark if he gets rid of brian jordan then i d have to believe that he and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings cox ok keep trying on bream and i ll wait til the trading deadline for my hunter klesko platoon maybe i can get a few extra at bats for cabrera while we wait try california if snow starts slowly maybe whiteydal will bite on sid and if that does n t work then perhaps sid s knees could be persuaded to act up there s always the qqq dl mwa ha ha ha ha schuerholz what about caraballo cox well he s not that much better than lemke maybe if he starts in richmond he ll start walking more besides if he s going to be arbitration eligible better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks schuerholz now let s see that leaves lopez cox nooooo i got ta keep lopez sure i did n t think olson would recover this quickly maybe i can talk caminiti into running into him again schuerholz nope lopez has got ta go you know that he ll get qqq million in arbitration may as well put it off that one extra year besides until olson s shown his stuff a little bit i ca n t trade him besides berryhill s a left handed hitter you know how rare that is cox do n t you mean a left handed whiffer pretty common if you ask me i mean he made pat borders look good in the world series pat borders schuerholz hey you re the one who would n t write lopez into the lineup cox well you re the one who went out and got me jeff reardon besides i thought lopez would n t be used to our pitching staff s stuff he got some time with them this spring looked pretty good come on surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate schuerholz yeah but which stiff whichever one we keep will be hurt by may cox ok ok you made your point keep them both surely one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest then i can call up lopez and then we can win qqq games the pennant the world series i ll be up there with john mcgraw casey stengel earl weaver oh they laughed at me in toronto but have you ever had to deal with george bell i ll finally get my just reward mwa ha ha ha schuerholz easy bobby have you been taking those happy pills left around by chuck tanner why d you ever hire that guy anyhow cox do n t ask me ask ted eric roush fierkelab bchm biochem duke edu i am a

detroit is a very disciplined team there s a lot of europeans in detroit which would make the game fast so toronto would have to slow the game down which means drawing penalties as a last resort anyway toronto will be a good team as soon as they get more good players toronto is just an average team detroit is n t ballard screwed toronto when he was owner everyone knows that and it s going to take time for toronto to become a real force i expect gilmour to be burnt out next year he ca n t pull the whole team forever .,1

but they faced the phillies a team that got off to an qqq qqq start to be honest i think the city of houston loves the new owner he has brought baseball back to houston with key acquisitions players that were from the houston area and wanted to play for the astros i do n t think that too many people are fearful that mclane will meddle in the team as he has already admitted that he does n t know a whole lot about baseball mclane is a businessman and does n t like excuses he makes a valid point that injuries should n t be an excuse to this club look at the depth of the bench this season canadele can play qqq positions bass and james are solid outfielders and can hit well too uribe is nice to have as well the pitching staff has qqq legitimate starters we re dealing with a young houston team so injuries should n t play a big role the only threat is the bullpen if jonesy goes out we may be in trouble but with the type of starters we have this season there is less pressure on the pen .,0

this is a phenomenon known around work as ready fire aim i am astounded at the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only do n t understand but publicly admit to not understanding in fact there s a plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins for the record there are two ways that a reliever can get a save he must finish the game and either qqq have entered the game with the tying run on base at bat or on deck qqq have pitched at least three innings effectively a pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game but this is an argument that wins is a dumb stat not saves this again does n t support your claim about saves at the beginning of your post mike jones aix high end development mjones donald aix kingston ibm com,0

well in my opinion the canucks played a really strong game i was especially pleased by a very strong game from linden i think he could be a key to success for them this year defensively they really had a strong game hardly heard selanne s name all night craven also played one of his best games since coming over with a few exceptions they really did n t let the high flying jets do much high flying i thought the jets defence looked overmatched by the canucks forwards they will have to improve on that if they want to make this a series in short it was a great start !,1

this is not a trend the caps were done goneso in five games and it saves us caps fans a lot of pain i mean it would be more painful if the caps were up qqq qqq watching them tumbled when they need one more win to clinch the series how many times have they done that in their history qqq up qqq qqq in a five game series against the isles lost qqq straight qqq up qqq qqq against the isles lost qqq straight qqq up qqq qqq against the pens lost qqq straight in other words when they were about to clinch with qqq games to go they were a pitiful qqq qqq the lone wins being qqq a sweep of philly in qqq qqq the qqq win against the rangers in the patrick finals the only time they managed to get out of the division actually saturday s blown lead was n t anything new we all know the caps are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games examples qqq game qqq against the isles qqq led qqq qqq after two lead series qqq qqq gave up qqq goals in the qqq period including the game winning goal in the last minute after that goal bobby carpenter botched a penalty shot series tied qqq qqq lost game qqq a few days later qqq game qqq against the rangers qqq led series qqq qqq led by qqq in the qqq period blew it lost game in ot and three consecutive games qqq game qqq against pittsurgh qqq led series qqq qqq led by qqq in qqq period blew it and the series qqq game qqq against isles qqq series tied qqq qqq led by qqq after qqq blew it qqq game qqq against isles qqq trailed series qqq qqq led by qqq in qqq period blew it again when they were leading by qqq in game qqq i said to myself if they blew this lead the series is over they have lost all the momemtum the islanders believe they can come back no matter what the score is i am still waiting for a cap goalie who can carry the team who can completely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear lives in a crucial game well some teams such have it and some teams just do n t when the caps were frustrated year in year out by the islanders i was thinking wait until potvin bossy trottier smith retire well they retired even though trottier was still able to haunt the caps on a pens uniform yet another generation of islanders were still doing the same thing well i guess it has nothing to do with the players .,1

in the boston area you can hear the rangers on wfan and the devils on wabc the whalers on wtic and the red wings on wjr this of course is in addition to the bruins who are currently on weei but may move to whdh because the fools at weei are owned by the celtics and thus will show them over the bruins every time there is a conflict you can also get wbal baltimore but i do n t think they have hockey btw i once got a station from indiana that had fort wayne comets games .,1
little i know what you mean i glow everytime ronnie s out on the ice in fact one of the neatest things about seeing the pens in person is that i can key in on him instead of watching what i d probably be seeing on tv he does so many subtle things behind the play he said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two way hockey that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart he was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in pittsburgh to the team whose forwards for the most part could n t and would n t play a lick of defense it s really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the pens you mention rick tocchet and he has certainly helped and even ol kjell has been steady but looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it would n t matter if i had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be qqq tom barrasso qqq ron francis qqq larry murphy i d love to put francis first but i do think the only thing that could really damage the pens right now would be to lose barrasso ),1

well put jason i am not from wisconsin but i have close relatives who live in port washington about qqq minutes north of milwaukee i visit the city regularly and i have been in the bradley four times to see the admirals play and the ncaa hockey championships it is a beautiful building the pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in north america as to what will happen with the admirals if milwaukee does acquire a franchise word is the team will move to green bay and play in the brown county arena once again the admirals are an independent franchise and the people of milwaukee have been supporting them well the games i have been to have seen crowds anywhere from qqq to qqq which are numbers some nhl teams i e the islanders hartford new jersey would be envious of having on some nights plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without the glamour of having an nhl club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount of hockey interest exists in the city sincerely martin hill rt qqq box qqq sault ste marie mi home of lssu go lakers ),1

and now i interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you another message sponsored by the department of really mundane statistics i passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through a filter to average out games goals assists points and penalty minutes for the mythical average nhl pro who played in the league this season why because it s monday and i did n t feel like writing any real code anyway after i wiped out the qqq goalies in the list i came up with nhl average qqq gp qqq g qqq a qqq pts qqq pim then i passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories marty mcinnis nyi qqq gp qqq qqq g qqq qqq a qqq qqq pts qqq qqq pim qqq igor kravchuk edm qqq gp qqq qqq g qqq qqq a qqq qqq pts qqq qqq pim qqq these two are close in games goals assists and points but are too far off in pim this leaves as the most average player in the nhl bobby carpenter was qqq gp qqq qqq g qqq qqq a qqq qqq pts qqq qqq pim qqq what an honor i also passed the list through with the goalies still included kravchuk and carpenter were still in the top three but rob dimaio came flying up from behind to take the title nhl average qqq gp qqq g qqq a qqq pts qqq pim igor kravchuk edm qqq gp qqq qqq g qqq qqq a qqq qqq pts qqq qqq pim qqq bobby carpenter was qqq gp qqq qqq g qqq qqq a qqq qqq pts qqq qqq pim qqq rob dimaio tb qqq gp qqq qqq g qqq qqq a qqq qqq pts qqq qqq pim qqq it s all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it sg,1
has jack lost a bit of his edge what is the worst start jack morris has had uh jack lost his edge about qqq years ago and has had only one above average year in the last qqq again goes to prove that it is better to be good than lucky you can count on good tomorrow lucky seems to be prone to bad starts and a bad finish last year yes i am enjoying every last run he gives up who was it who said morris was a better signing than viola hey valentine i do n t see boston with any world series rings on their fingers oooooo cheap shot damn morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his future who cares he had two of them before he came to toronto and if the jays had signed viola instead of morris it would have been frank who won qqq and got the ring and he would be on his way to qqq this year too therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing your logic is curious and spurious there is no reason to believe that viola would n t have won as many games had he signed with toronto when you compare their stupid w l records be sure to compare their team s offensive averages too now looking at anything like the morris viola sweepstakes a year later is basically hindsight but there were plenty of reasons why it should have been apparent that viola was the better pitcher based on previous recent years and also based on age frank is almost qqq years younger how many knew that people got caught up in the qqq world series and then on morris qqq wins last year wins are the stupidest most misleading statistic in baseball far worse than rbi or r that he won qqq just means that the jays got him a lot of runs the only really valid retort to valentine is were n t the red sox trying to get morris too oh sure they said viola was their first choice afterwards but what should we have expected they would say and do n t tell me boston will win this year they wo n t even be in the top qqq in the division more like qqq if this is true it wo n t be for lack of contribution by viola so who cares ?,0

sorry sherri but i ca n t agree with this particular incident while i m all for cutting down the number of chain rattles and other examples of rampant hargroving there was a difference here qqq since time immemorial batters have complained about calls so have pitchers and catchers usually nothing happens unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing complaints hirschbeck was acting against expectations qqq it s not as if gant was in hirschbeck s face gant said something about the call stepped out of the box and turned away from hirschbeck as a hitter alibet of little consequence but with a decent eye whenever receiving the short end of the stick on a questionable call i d want a moment or two out of the box if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on the experience of the last pitch and if i was really angry at the ump i d rather turn away and catch my breath than turn to him and say something that might get me tossed especially at a key moment in the game when gant turned away hirschbeck immediately motioned for gant to step into the box imo at this point in time hirschbeck was determined to show gant exactly who was in charge of this game gant was n t dawdling he had n t had a chance to dawdle and hirschbeck was simply exercising a power play gant resisted as many of us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request and hirschbeck called for the pitch at that point cox came out on the field the pitch was thrown and many other braves left the dugout cox was tossed protecting his player i was pleasantly surprised that gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game it s a small sample size but based on what i saw in that game mark hirschbeck has a hair trigger temper and a need to play god on the field not good qualities for an umpire i will keep my eyes open for future appearances of hirschbeck in the future in order to improve my sample size imo any game where you remember the name of the umpire was a bad game for the umpire .,0

cardinals for poor without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war i would like to question the notion that sitting a rested player down has any real effect on his long term performance sure if a man is tired and needs real rest then taking a break might be a constructive act perhaps if a man is mentally strained then sitting him down might help to the extent that that helps him relax but i would like to suggest that in the long run players do slump and benching is probably irrelevant .,0

disclaimer this is for fun in my computerized baseball game i keep track of a category called stolen hits defined as a play made that an average fielder would not make with average effort using the qqq defensive averages posted by sherri nichols thanks sherri i ve figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen hits stolen have been redefined as plays kurt stillwell would not have made ok i realize that s unfair kurt s probably the victim of pitching staff fluke shots and a monster park factor but let s put it this way if we replaced every second baseman in the nl with someone with kurt s qqq out making ability how many extra hits would go by to try and correlate it to reality a little more i ve calculated net hits stolen based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make by the same method i ve calculated net double plays and net extra bases doubles and triples let by finally i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution or dcon basically it represents the defensive contribution of a player i add this number to ops to get dops defense onbase plus slug which should represent the player s total contribution to the team so do n t take it too seriously the formula for dcon appears at the end of this article the short version definition of terms hs hits stolen extra outs compared to kurt stillwell nhs net hits stolen extra outs compared to average fielder ndp net double plays extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder neb net extra bases extra bases prevented compared to avg fielder dcon defensive contribution bases and hits prevented as a rate dops dcon ops quick dirty measure of player s total contribution national league name hs nhs ndp neb dcon dops alicea l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq sandberg r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq thompson r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lind j qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq doran b qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq deshields d qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq harris l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lemke m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq morandini m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq randolph w qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq biggio c qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq stillwell k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq ordered by dops qqq sandberg qqq alicea qqq thompson qqq deshields qqq doran qqq nl average qqq biggio qqq harris qqq randolph qqq morandini qqq lemke qqq lind qqq stillwell american league name hs nhs ndp neb dcon dops fletcher s qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq reed j qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq ripken b qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq baerga c qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq blankenship l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq miller k qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq alomar r qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq knoblauch c qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq bordick m qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq kelly p qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq whitaker l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq reynolds h qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq sax s qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq sojo l qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq order by dops qqq baerga qqq alomar qqq fletcher qqq whitaker qqq blankenship qqq miller qqq knoblauch qqq reed qqq bordick qqq al average qqq kelly qqq ripken qqq reynolds qqq sojo qqq sax more discussion dcon formula nhs ndp pa nhs ndp neb ab why such a bizzare formula basically it s designed to be added into the ops with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored the extra outs are factored into obp while the extra bases removed are factored into slg that s why i used pa and ab as the divisors for more discussion see the post on hits stolen first base qqq dale j stephenson steph cs uiuc edu baseball fanatic,0

well actually most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened but that s ok i understand you have a hockey background stats like plus minus make rbi look good ok how about a straigh answer then here s a very simele question to which i m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to please answer yes or no roger can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs al only please for anyone else following along it is a well known and demonstrable fact that a team s win loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows it s not a definite hard and fast function but there is definitely a correlation in fact as a rule of thumb if teams a and b both score x runs and team a allows y runs for every qqq runs fewer than y that team b allows it will win another game so for instance if we look at the qqq toronto blue jays we find that they scored qqq runs and allowed qqq of which morris allowed qqq all other things being equal if frank viola with his qqq era had replaced jack morris for the qqq innings morris threw plausible since viola threw qqq for boston the red jays would have allowed about qqq fewer runs or enough for qqq qqq more wins now that does n t take into account that viola pitched half his innings in fenway which is a harder park to pitch in particularly for a lefthander than skydome so um roger unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis clearly it would be foolhardy to claim that viola would necessarily have put up a qqq if he had been on the jay last year but that is not the claim we look at what the actual performances were and evaluate viola s as better than morris in the sense that had morris performed as viola did his team would have been better off this is true but not so open that your brain falls out mike jones aix high end development mjones donald aix kingston ibm com,0

everyone keeps talking about european expansion by qqq thinking wishful thoughts but being totally off the ball the league format we use here is incompatible with that in europe for those that do n t know the best teams from lower divisions get promoted and the worst get demoted would european fans put up with our if you ve paid you can play attitude how long would they support teams that are run on ranger based corporate thinking i use the term lightly we do n t need a good product because these duffuses in nyc would fill the arena for ottawa s record every year qqq haha sorry had ta say it if hockey and other pro sports had a similar system to europe maybe teams like the rangers would be forced to compete or get demoted the fourth division we d have many more teams centres that are n t as big like halifax or adirondack ok so halifax is n t a good example would eventually get promoted and every team would be somewhat competetive within its own division unlike ottawa sj edmonton etc fans would eventually get rewarded for their loyalty or penalized for their neglect and the league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx of newly promoted teams and the halifax citadels win the stanley cup i can dream ca n t i look at british or any european soccer as an example they never have fan problems just someone who thinks our system really sucks barfly feel free to flame me my account ends today hahahaha ),1

to all the braves doubters do n t worry the bats will come alive and the braves will come around the pitching is solid and as long the braves do n t have serious injuries to the starting rotation they ll continue to pitch well heck with the five starters on the braves rotation they could even sustain an injury to one of the five i hope this does n t happen though the bats are there pendleton will certainly bat over qqq justice is catching fire bream nixon sanders gant well there s too much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer right now the cleveland indians have qqq players batting over qqq but i certainly would n t their seven for our respective seven though would n t the braves be something right now with their pitching and qqq players batting over qqq the bullpen well it is suspect but when the bats come alive the guys in the bullpen will be of less concern so anyway i believe the braves will be tough to beat this season i m not saying the braves have automatically won the division but i m optim istic about their season though it s awful painful to watch them at times right now go braves !,0

i wondered the same thing when he first mentioned it i thought he was just making a mistake but then he said it over and over and then in the examples from other years he gave stats for players from both leagues even when only one league expanded so since stats never lie i guess there is an effect on both leagues because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up players that normally they would not have had there not been expansion .,0

sh i m a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best i can here in the hockey hinterlands oklahoma i m hoping i can get a reading from some of you about the move of the north stars to dallas sh i ve been under the impression that minnesota was one of or possibly the hockey state in the u s so why is the team moving to a city in texas is it that the owner is a greedy self serving profiteer or were the stars really not making a profit or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging sh as much as i d like to see the nhl only a qqq hour drive from me i ca n t help but feel for the people in minnesota unless they truly did n t support the team sh opinions please i used to work for the stars minnesota supported the team to an extent when i was there we had quite afew sellouts this was the season after the cup run and during the finals norm s main bitch was that there was n t enough luxury suites and the ones he had were not always full he wanted more boxes and wanted them full he was just asking for too much from people that could go and see other hockey games at high schools for qqq or college for about qqq that would probably be better mark þ qmpro qqq qqq qqq þ radioactive cats are very very hot !,1
the same bill james why do you say that it sounds like you re suggesting bill james had something to do with overhyping the kid to death au contraire he was fairly critical of him after his roy campaign noting that he was n t all world as a catcher or a hitter he called him basically average when everyone else in the media was predicting the next johnny bench or roy campanella which reports are those i like hernandez a lot but if piazza can catch the ball you ve got ta play him imho he s a much better hitter although hernandez is n t a bad hitter right now it sounds like piazza will catch most of the time and hernandez will be candiotti s caddy since he can catch the knuckler as long as they play up to their abilities the dodgers could have a very good catching tandem i think both are overrated defensively see nichols law of catcher defense but that s something that s difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine about the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent s sb and that s clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners catchers era is a possibility but it s subject to way too many biases as for them playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat i disagree here too about the only chink in the braves armor is that they re weak offensively at several positions cf c qqq ss if belliard plays qqq unless bream and hunter form another super platoon and very weak defensively if blauser plays i d like to see the braves give at least one of mel nieves javy lopez or chipper jones a shot but much like the talent rich jays of recent years they ll be conservative and stick with what they have i m not saying that s wrong just conservative .,0

actually i was hoping for barry bonds oh well first off jeff has had like qqq hits in the last two games and walked yet again sorry ken but jeff king does have some power which means his slg wo n t be below qqq and his walks are way up if that increase is real jeff king will be an above average nl third baseman in qqq jose lind on the other hand still does n t walk and clearly is n t a qqq hitter my bet is that he wo n t be getting any extra bases either once everybody starts pulling the lind shift we were seeing in the nl no although since the lavalliere weirdness nothing would really surprise me jeff king is currently in the top qqq in the league in walks something is up .,0
funny it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks which are nothing but collections of statistics are authored by bill james and stats inc and howe for the minor league handbook and i am not sure how the qqq bill james player ratings book qualifies as a book with statistics while the elias analyst is a statistics book the analyst contains more stats sure but it also contains more dialogue finally the point was not about the word statistics it was about money grubbing i do n t see how anyone who has looked at the bill james player ratings book can not consider him money grubbing .,0

stuff about ron gant incident deleted i agree that hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do and also that gant should have listened to him however what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games you are the first person non mediot i have seen endorse this policy i have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the espn crowd and other announcers bitching about it i have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and shouting hurry up if i cough up big bucks for a ticket i do n t mind a game that last more than qqq i really do n t understand it games are longer now for several reasons more pitching changes more basestealing and throws to first etc i think a very small factor is the increased time it takes jose canseco deion sanders insert fancy showboat ballplayer here to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the batter s box my impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this an issue because they like shorter games they get to head back to hotel bar eat steaks get drunk tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase stewardesses around the bar sure they want the game over with print journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games they have deadlines the espn guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy they constantly harp on this primarily because they often have to work late when the game goes longer than qqq maybe i am just a ne er do well with nothing better to do but i would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you as a parenthetical note it seems the league is in any case fighting a losing battle this year the increased offense thus far will certainly spoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly .,0
ah so now we re into european player bashing what next no more french canadiens yeah there s an idea let them french speaking canadiens have their own hockey league we do n t want them are you _ crazy _ the nhl is one of the true international leagues and yes there _ are _ many europeans who deserve to play in the nhl and are better than some north americans look at teemu i for one am glad to see europeans in the nhl and i hope the nhl soon expands to europe its nice to see all these different people come together to form the soon to be qqq hockey teams darryl brooks university at buffalo _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ /,1

i d like to add that i think canadian hockey fans like don because his kind of hockey the hockey he promotes in his tv appearances is the kind that they think used to get played in the old qqq team nhl so there s a kind of nostagia for the old days before expansion the soviet series gretzky and even bobby orr when guys were n t afraid to take a hit nobody floated and defensemen played defence who cares that that probably never really existed the myth is still around in canada and all the european in fluence on the game has diminished it in some people s eyes personally i d like to add before i get flamed i love the fast paced european game and think don cherry is a bit of an idiot i have to say that i missed him when i was living in the states though he is entertaining even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he s on i stand by all the misstatements that i ve made vice president dan quayle to sam donaldson qqq,1
just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the dodgers one of my least favorite in la sweet also the mets my other least favorite team loss to the rockies made this this a great day and a great start to the weekend as the cardinals are on the espn tonight big lee smith is having a great start and the cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training the runners lob will be lower this year probably due to the high strikeout numbers by jose and lankford and zeile s off year i do n t know why all the fuss about the fillies the media and all the filly fans on r s b forget who is right behind them in the standings give the wild thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games and we ll see who is in first then i believe the cardinal pitching staff is more complete than the filly staff and that will make the difference on a side note a few years ago qqq qqq a comment was made by some baseball player or manager about the dodger defense he was asked where to hit the ball against the dodgers and he replied fair i remember it being in the they said it section of sports illustrated i would like to know who said it and what issue it was in go redbirds !,0
of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented just as a penny saved is a penny earned enough with the cliches my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to their potential they wo n t need much offensive support i realize this is a big if this staff leaves the qqq bosox in the dust there is no legitimate comparison two cy young winners and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound the other teams score less runs the team that scores the most runs wins this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs a low scoring game would clearly benefit the braves they should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting on the flip side if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers they would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent the name of the games is to win even ray knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard all i m trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the braves have the offense does n t need to be as strong .,0
from this account it does n t sound like you even saw the goal mike smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit fuhr in the back of the leg fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened the puck went straight off fuhr s leg and into the net fuhr never had a chance there was no play back to the goaltender in fact perry berezan of calgary had just dumped it in and smith was retrieving it it was unfortunate that it happened smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie at the time and on his birthday too but all the blame lies with him starting in pee wee coaches tell players never to make a cross ice pass in front of their own net too much chance of having it intercepted or hitting the goaltender or whatever and to the people who say that smith cost the oilers the series i can only say that he certainly did n t cause the team to lose the other three games there was no reason for a powerhouse team like edmonton to be tied late in the third period of the qqq game of the second round everybody on the team has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation .,1

i agree it was great for the espn people to show the detroit game my roommate just about sh t when they threw the octopus on the ice thanks for explaining the significance of that btw the only problem i had was when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and music especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report other then that hats off to espn now if they ll only make a habit of this yeah right baseball seasons started zzzzzz koz,1

the giants always hit maddux well but it was interesting that maddux did not pitch around bonds to get to clayton last night he threw qqq straight fastballs over the plate to bonds in the qqq last night got away with the first one but bonds hit the second one out of the park then in the qqq when clark was at third base with one out maddux did not intentionally walk bonds and bonds dropped a single to left center the braves announcers pointed out that mcgee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet he will always hit around qqq but i m concerning about his on base percentage the key in the lineup is matt williams he has to stay hot so that bonds can hit with runners on base the pitching gets a set back as bud black is placed on the dl burba has done a superb job filling in so far he looks like a different pitcher from last year however swift is terrible in both of his starts with burba moving into the rotation mike jackson is the only right handed reliever aside from rod beck he ll get a lot of actions i also hope that dusty can manage his bullpen better than roger craig especially on beck i was concerned when beck was used for qqq straight days earlier this week so far so good !,0

quite honestly this one is ridiculous consider the following scenario runner on third as the pitcher starts to throw home the runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for the suicide squeeze the pitcher seeing this does not throw home but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down it is the balk rule that prevents this from happening believe it or not this actually happened to me once in an oba ontario baseball association game in milton ontario i was the batter and to my amazement the umpire missed it in the qqq years that i played ball this was worst piece of umpiring i ever saw .,0

qqq qqq los angeles kings notes playoffs stauber disturbed by third man theme by rick sadowski daily news barry melrose s decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year the most fun time of the year and i m not stauber said with some emotion monday i think i have worked hard enough for that stauber said he accepts melrose s choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the calgary flames hrudey made qqq saves in sundays qqq qqq opening victory but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no qqq man behind rick knickle stauber had a qqq qqq qqq record and qqq goals against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no qqq job from hrudey knickle he won qqq of qqq decisions but had a bloated qqq average twice was yanked from games once for stomach cramps and has n t played since march qqq yet when the series resumes wednesday knickle will serve as hrudey s backup again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic saddledome popcorn if i m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter i dropped too qqq what happened to no qqq stauber wondered not that i d be happy with no qqq but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance but melrose apparently is not convinced the qqq old is capable of handling playoff pressure while insisting he is the kings goalie of the future melrose said stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season they were according to melrose a qqq qqq loss to san jose on dec qqq an qqq qqq loss to the new york rangers on jan qqq a qqq qqq tie with detroit on feb qqq an qqq qqq loss to vancouver on thursday four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie he could have taken it away from kelly hrudey and he did n t do it melrose said an elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him the mark of a great goalie is that he is n t satisfied to be a backup i m not blaming robb for the losses but if you re going to be no qqq you ve got to be able to walk your talk you ve got to be able to play when everything is on the line robb stauber has a great deal of ability but maybe i expect more from him than he does ouch that remark stung stauber he began the season qqq qqq qqq struggled when the team hit a mid season slump did n t play for a month after knickle was signed off the san diego gulls roster then came on at the end i expect more from myself than anybody including barry melrose said stauber a three year star at the university of minnesota who left school in qqq only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries what i ve been through the last four years two knee operations a herniated disk in my back shoulder surgery what more can i go through i obviously do expect a lot from myself otherwise i would n t be here anybody who would disagree with that does n t know me i m not saying barry does n t know me but do n t say i ve been without expectations if anything i m a perfectionist stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games melrose mentioned but even though i did n t play well i get knocked down from maybe on to three it s a bit of a jump he said you re almost no qqq or if you play a good game you re no qqq and if you do n t you re no qqq why does jack nicklaus shoot a qqq and then a qqq can you explain that that s what barry wanted me to explain to him why i did n t come through when he counted on me i do n t know what i do know is it s a sport i ll be there melrose s goalie of the future statement does n t mean much to stauber before you know it i ll be qqq and there will be no future he said game qqq of the kings flames playoff series drew a qqq nielsen rating on abc channel qqq here in la the kings averaged a qqq nielsen rating in the qqq regular season games aired on channel qqq around the nhl san jose fired coach george kingston who lead the team to a qqq qqq qqq mark in their qqq nhl season kingston was qqq qqq qqq over the past qqq years with the sharks former islander executive bill torrey was named as president of the expansion florida panthers bobby clarke was named as the clubs general manager last nights games win qqq van qqq van leads qqq qqq tor qqq det qqq det leads qqq qqq stan willis willis empire dnet hac com net contact l a kings,1

nesn owns the rights to bruin telecasts i suspect that nesn was only going to sell one telecast to espn remember espn only owns exclusive rights to the finals not the entire playoffs since espn bought the sca contract there are less wrangles to untie with showing the devils and penguins i think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it plus they have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule unless the nhl was willing to make a western club move up their game i think the nhl got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for abc same exact coverage as last week pit nj game qqq in the east chi stl in the central la cgy in the mountains and west .,1
no problem no offence taken it is sad just as a lover of the sport that this team can be in the metro new york area for over a decade and still exist as just a non entity we re getting the sabres bruins as the replacement game and probably so are you while the devils penguins game is played on scny and the islanders caps are the overflow game on the sca scny plus if the sabres bruins ends early then we ll go to the devils penguins game assuming that espn follows their previous patterns we got the last minute of the islanders rangers and all of the overtime two weeks ago espn s coverage started last night by accident but as one or more other writers have pointed out they could ve gone to wild hog wrestling for the evening instead gld,1

it is meaningless to compare one player s plus minus statistic with another players out of the context of the role and the playing time of the players involved to compare jagr s and francis s plus minus is ridiculous and absurd gerald thank you for putting this in perspective !,1
i think murray has done a great job he s picked up ciccarelli sheppard ysebaert howe coffey and riendeau plus some depth players without giving up anything the wings needed or any of his top prospects all of this in three years has anyone done better the year before he took over the wings did n t even make the playoffs there was about a year and a half during demers stint that the wings did ok but that was due to demers motavational skills and clutch and grab style they did n t have much talent gerald murray was n t responsible for primeau although i m not ready to admit that s a horrible pick they hired him after the draft which has never made sense to me his first pick was lapointe ron,1

us easterners who have newspapers with editors unsympathetic to playoff pools often do n t get summaries from west coast games since they finish too late at night for the morning edition i and i m sure others too would greatly appreciate it if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games could be posted to this group right away basically all we need are goal scorers and assists do n t bother with times penalties shots etc this would make a lot of pool obsessed people very happy i guess with the senators out golfing now the local papers have lost interest thanks kd .,1
every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball being qqq offense qqq defense a run scored is just as important as a run prevented this certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what percent is fielding i d really like to know btw sherri thanks for the da data i find it fascinating one of the chapters in palmer and thorn s hidden game is titled pitching is qqq of baseball implying that fielding is qqq how do they determine that beats me it s been a long long time since i read it one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the split probably somewhere around qqq and qqq -,0

not bad we had a similar situation slowpitch softball bases loaded weakest hitter at the plate he hits a line drive over the third baseman s head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in foul ground almost hitting the fence down that side of the field but the umpire called fair ball i was coaching third yelling at evrybody to move up a base the ump s position it was still fair when it passed third base why the other team did n t immediately protest i ll never know we certainly were n t going to argue about it since every body did manage to advance one base safely there was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my runner from second base leg fielded by the ss steps on second to force the runner from first and throw to first in time for what the umpire called a triple play protest removed when we won the game anyway .,0
during the first three games of the pens devils series i have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the pens jagr maceachern and barrasso have been especially fun to watch but one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be scotty bowman despite brooks lunatic comments and despite the devils line changing adantage in last night s game bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the devils in the dark granted the hell dwellers had the pens bottled up for a while last night but bowman was eventually able to configure his line up to get the job done his ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis last night for instance he realized that the speed of jagr straka and maceachern was throwing the devils off balance as a result straka received many more shifts than average jagr played almost the entire game he was always on the puck and maceachern scored a goal while complementing jagr many times throughout the night his ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate and to bring about success .,1

golly i love stupid people listen rex this is hockey the nhl to be precise and in the nhl there exist these things called ties a tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal each team gets one point for a tie there also exits these things called wins a win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent oh yeah only two teams play each other at a time so i can say the opponent a team gets two points for a win so let s say that a team has a record of qqq wins qqq losses and qqq ties another team has a record of qqq wins qqq losses and qqq ties the first team has qqq qqq qqq points the second team has qqq qqq qqq points wow they both have the same number of points but the number of wins is different how did they do that that s amazing so rex when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker well then that s what it means in our example the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the better record even though both teams had the same number of points if you did n t understand this post rex maybe you should go back and read it again very slowly keith keller let s go rangers let s go quakers kkeller mail sas upenn edu ivy league champs !,1

i can only comment on the kings but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is alex zhitnik he came highly touted as a defensive defenseman but he s clearly much more than that great skater and hard shot though wish he were more accurate in fact he pretty much allowed the kings to trade away that huge defensive liability paul coffey kelly hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with but at best he s only a mediocre goaltender a better choice would be tomas sandstrom though not through any fault of his own but because some thugs in toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal other than that the award goes to robert lang an uninspiring czech robitaille could easily be mvp but i d prefer to give it to rob blake who is quietly becoming one of the league s premier defensemen and if the kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense it could one day mean that we ll let in fewer goals than hartford honorable mentions to majestic marty and warren rychel jon,1

from another not so distressed but still wondering about a few things cardinal fan he s not the greatest this is true i saw it lankford was hurt although the announcer said he told torre he could pinch hit if they needed him to i wondered the same thing but giving joe the benefit of the doubt i d say he was thinking that lankford is hurt enough that he did n t trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his speed on the bases so pinch run him alicea i was completely confused about maybe he had a good record hitting against that particular pitcher i do n t know anybody got an idea well so far i have n t seen much to say whiten should n t be playing but it is too bad that gilkey is the odd man out when they play jordan ahead of him that i do n t quite understand yup i looked for this on the replay too if i m joe torre i m going to have a talk with bucky after the game on that one he s got lankford at third with todd zeile i believe a hot hitter coming up there s no reason to risk giving lankford the go sign in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands it s his job to watch the play develop he should have known larkin was there to back up a bad throw that seemed inexcusable in my book btw i saw dent do the same thing last year with zeile rounding third and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation on the replay there s dent waving him around it looks like this might be a serious problem the card s were n t good base runners at all last year and i wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching well i m still hanging in there go redbirds woof woof dick detweiler,0
mark singer brings up the strawberry incident where he lost a homerun and the fan caught it yes i think he should have done more to get out of the way as much as fans want to catch a ball they really should be aware that winning the game is more important as a dodger fan he has to be aware that this is the home stadium and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible as soon as the ball was hit that far his first instinct should be to root for darryl to catch it not to try to catch it himself particularly when he is sitting that close i enjoy the attitude of the wrigley fans where they are against visiting team home runs so much they actually throw them back on the field now this has nothing to do with whether darryl could have caught it or not sure he probably screwed up but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win .,0
ah but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and a sense of urgency because of the game clock not all the time but it happens when there s less than qqq minutes to go quite often this sense creates drama even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer s attention in baseball only qqq players are involved in the action for about here comes a wild guess qqq of the time and they re just playing a sophisticated game of catch hold the ball step out of the box adjust chains touch self in interesting locations there s a lot of dead time with the players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher who then takes qqq qqq pitches or helen dell playing the organ dodger fans will appreciate that one to the non baseball junkie this is boring at any rate i m not putting baseball down for this i ve been an avid fan since i can remember it s just that watching a baseball game on t v at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie that s what major league baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of shortening the game it s because of t v not because football has more action than baseball .,0

the probability is that the oilers are not going anywhere pocklington has chosen this moment to make his last stand is because he is at the moment of maximum advantage the provincial government is months away from a provincial election it is the moment when he has maximum power to convince northlands to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price and it is before the nhl s new collective agreement with the players which might involve some enhanced revenue sharing pocklington is many things stupid is not one of them he can dictate terms because other cities will pay his price if edmonton does n t edmonton has already fucked up its international airport and surrendered supremacy to calgary and over the next few years edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks it will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find a way to lose its hockey team too because northlands wants to continue to use the oilers to subsidize horse racing however in this case about the long term financial viability of the oilers the fact is that pocklington is basically right regardless of who owns the team and it is right to provoke the crisis now before the team accumulates millions of dollars in losses or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack of money sather has done his job the oilers are poised to be competitive again very soon al strachan one of the most knowledgeble hockey writers in canada in a post mortem of the oilers season in the globe and mail recently agrees with me ),1

qqq having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get more good pitches to hit this is important since he struggles so much with breaking balls opposing pitchers do n t want to walk williams to get to bonds i have to wonder if this good hitter behind you argument is really valid has anyone done a study on this you want a study look at matt williams the year after mitchell was gone look no further not a scientific study but it ll show the truth for matt besides bonds _ wants _ to bat qqq i had thought that williams batted after mitchell would n t that show that williams does better at qqq rather than qqq the point is moot though becase clark pretty much demands to be qqq and like you point out bonds does like to bat qqq the only person left to bat qqq is williams .,0

i would n t give baserunning that much value the above effect is clear but there are other effects as well if olerud hits a double any runner on first will score if alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap the runner on first may need to hold at third thus olerud s doubles have more advancement value than alomar s of course alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams no team in the qqq s ran much but some teams certainly had faster players than others still the current runs created formulas work just as well in the qqq s for all teams bill james gives the qqq qqq senators as an example they used harmon killebrew regularly as a pinch runner and in qqq stole qqq bases with qqq times caught stealing yet they scored slightly more runs than predicted by runs created .,0

so what is your definition of interfering with the fielder taking the throw the rule book certainly does n t have a definiton or clarification so it s possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter his throw to avoid hitting the batter runner then again we have interference you know it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly if the catcher or the pitcher say rob dibble for example throws toward first and hits the runner running inside the baseline the fielder takes the chance of being ejected therefore he probably would throw around the runner or your scenario above him you should note that in our american legion league which uses mlb rules we interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there is interference per rule qqq .,0

it was a classy move but it looks like espn is going to devote most of the coverage to the pens on tuesday night they continued to broadcast the pen devil game even though pittsburgh had the game well in control granted they did show some bonus coverage of the caps and isles but they cut away from the close game which went into double ot to update us on the fifth goal of the rout thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between the pens and devils imho they should program some variety into the telecasts yes i know the game shown on saturday is between the b s and sabres probably throwing a bone to us bruin fans and what about the cambell conference i d like to see a game in the norris or smythe why not have back to back nights of national hockey night just a thought .,1

this is the crux of the argument to me at least both the sdcn and the non sdcn camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher s defense is basically nonmeasurable at present you can talk about how important calling a game is or framing the pitches or blocking balls in the dirt but there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catcher s rank in defense looking at lopez specifically is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the braves or the media has labeled him a bad defensive catcher as far as i can tell he does n t have any particular problem in his mechanics such as sasser he might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time i ca n t see how repetitions at aaa are any better then reps in the majors all we re left with is the calling the game aspect olsen and berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff but this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers how is catching at aaa going to help lopez learn the major league pitching staff the only way any catcher is going to learn tom glavine s pitches is to catch tom glavine similarly i would n t be supprised if the pitcher s claimed to prefer pitching to olsen over pitching to lopez because they are used to pitching to olsen but given time they will say they are comfortable with lopez now since lopez ca n t learn how to handle the major league pitcher s while he s in aaa and since he does n t have any glaring problem in his mechanics what is he going to learn in aaa that he ca n t learn just as well while in the majors ?,0

how was this trade bad i seem to recall ratelle and middleton making a pretty good centre right wing combination and the bruins also got brad park in the deal and they also lost vadnais and somebody else after the trade the bruins were in two finals and one semi final all of which of course they lost to montreal which should please you to no end i doubt however keeping esposito would have made a difference in those series as he did not for the rangers in qqq or any of his years in boston for that matter riston riston,1
geez everyone comes up with clark williams thompson these guys were all up in qqq that s ancient history so in the last qqq years noone right beck does n t count i said qqq solid years let s see what he does w o the help of a pitchout every other pitch as i remember even bob brenly had a good throwout percentage under roger craig who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown out of course he suffered from qqq ball qqq strike homers a lot too i am not a big fan of manwaring .,0

the roar at michigan and trumbull should be loader than ever this year with mike illitch at the head and ernie harwell back at the booth the tiger bats will bang this summer already they have scored qqq runs in two games and with fielder tettleton and deer i think they can win the division no pitching bull gully moore wells and krueger make up a decent staff that will keep the team into many games then there is henneman to close it out watch out boston toronto and baltimore the motor city kittys are back nice woofing or should i say meowing and yes the tiggers are a fun exciting team that i would pay to see but last year they went qqq qqq this year their offense is essentially the same and their pitching is at best essentially the same so why do you think they will suddenly improve to win the qqq or so games which will be required to win the a l east what has changed that i do n t see remember a qqq qqq win is worth as much in the standings as a qqq qqq win .,0

i do n t really mind the length of games either if they want to speed the games up in sensible ways that s fine with me too however what i object to is the assertion by baseball people whitey herzog buck rodgers are who i ve heard say this that games are too long because hitters are taking too many pitches and that the strike zone needs to be expanded .,0
the term stopper is generally used to refer to a pitcher one who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going on a losing streak the braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description although right now i d expect smoltz or glavine to take the mantle what the braves lack however is an offensive stopper somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump there s just no one there the braves got rid of their best pure hitter lonnie smith and only terry pendleton on the current roster has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit oh and another thing that worries me ron gant seems to have slowed down a step that s scary a slow ron gant does n t have much going for him .,0

these new rule changes are great however i think that your rules are much too complicated how will the normal average fan be able to count how many fouls a player has and then we would even have to remember the names of the players in order to determine who drew the foul and of course there will have to be new sub positions like the power center who just sits in the slot until the blue of course puck comes near him and the shooting defenseman and the point defenseman finally we ll be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty shot takers since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled we ll be able to see ulf samuellson sp and tie domi miss penalty shots like crazy keith keller let s go rangers let s go quakers kkeller mail sas upenn edu ivy league champs !,1

apparently part qqq defensemen numbered qqq through qqq was lost when i posted it to make things worse i lost my own copy i have asked on the sharks mailing list on which it did get out to see if someone can mail me a copy back if someone responds i will repost it when i get it otherwise i will re write it in a day or two and post it sorry about that qqq larry depalma season qqq acquired qqq qqq free agent from minnesota grade i c d no netter fan watching the sharks including me knows where depalma was at the end of the season the sharks appeared to still have his rights but he was n t in san jose he was n t in kansas city and his name has n t appeared on the waiver wire and that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for depalma after being called up october qqq against the tampa bay lightning depalma had an excellent week scoring qqq points in qqq games while playing good defense unfortunately the qqq old depalma then disappeared the rest of the way getting just qqq more points in qqq more games and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice he then was sent down to kansas city walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of shark bytes as the mailing list is now known to sharks officials faithful and neither the sharks nor we miss him qqq johan garpenlov season qqq acquired qqq qqq trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and qqq round pick in qqq entry draft from vancouver grade a a after an early slump garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way finishing with qqq points in qqq games second highest total on the team as he clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob gaudreau kisio got most of the credit but garpenlov finishing second in the mvp voting clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders getting a club high qqq power play goals contrary to his previous rep garpenlov also showed that despite his small size qqq qqq qqq lbs he was willing to throw himself around when necessary albeit not very successful yet he also still needs to work on his defense although he improved tremendously throughout the season and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season he will be a major key to the offense next year qqq david bruce season qqq acquired qqq qqq from st louis in expansion draft grade i after a banner qqq qqq when he led the team in power play goals qqq and was third in total scoring qqq points in qqq games bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury which kept him out of the lineup for all by qqq games this season of course it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury but the qqq old bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the sharks first season and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well the injury appears serious which is a shame because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now instead his future with the sharks next season appears clouded qqq mark pederson season qqq acquired qqq qqq trade with philadelphia for c lw dave snuggerud grade i b it is difficult for me to understand the flyers decision to unload pederson after a very good offensive season last season qqq points in qqq games but after riding the pine early in the season pederson was summarily sent to the sharks in exchange of the defensive minded snuggerud and he finished with qqq games combined with the flyers and the sharks he was also limited by injuries this season and this limited his production qqq points but when healthy pederson appears impressive with a good scoring touch good size and the willingness to throw it around although he s not considered a physical forward and good speed he also does not appear to be a liability on defense but the sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much exactly pederson can do qqq john carter season qqq acquired qqq qqq free agent from boston grade i b b carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team and the hard work worked wonders as at times he looked great on ice however although he did look great at times the fact that he received just qqq points in qqq games for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do and the sharks confirmed that by sending him to kansas city with about qqq games left in the season carter who will turn qqq on may qqq always hussled but as a result was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking but he was generally a credit on the defensive end but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity and he did not impress offensively although he was one of the best sharks at drawing penalties he is very unlikely to be back next season qqq jean francois quintin season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i b b i do n t understand why the sharks did n t let quintin play any more than the qqq games he played this season he was generally hard working and creating opportunities offensively and appeared at age qqq ready for regular nhl duty at least for a team like the sharks finishing with qqq points in those qqq games while not being a defensive liability shoulder injury in training camp before the qqq qqq season limited quintin the team s leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two to just qqq games with the sharks and the blades that season but he looked impressive he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season qqq mark beaufait season qqq acquired qqq round pick in qqq supplemental draft grade i after a all star season at kansas city beaufait got a cup of coffey with the sharks late in the season when the blades knocked down a playoff spot and the sharks decimated with injuries playing qqq games and scoring a goal for his only nhl point thus far despite small size qqq qqq qqq lbs beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary and looked pretty good at times although it s too early to judge him based on qqq nhl games in which he played mostly left wing away from his center position at northern michigan and kansas city qqq jaroslav otevrel season qqq acquired qqq round pick in qqq entry draft grade i like beaufait otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea qqq games midway through the season he was generally very much of a defensive liability and did not show much offensively either although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those qqq games he may need another season to work on his defense but once his defense is acceptable he should be ready qqq michel picard season qqq acquired qqq qqq trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau grade i b c the qqq old picard although he perennially tore up the minors seems to be close to being out of chances for some reason after being acquired by the sharks but failing to impress the management in qqq games scoring qqq goals for his only points and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansas city he was not particularly strong defensively and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors he has failed thus far to score in the nhl although he has been given limited opportunities he may be the sharks bait in the expansion draft qqq dody wood season qqq acquired qqq round pick in qqq entry draft grade i d d although perhaps i should n t give a grade at all i have been accused of knocking on wood too much then it is probably no surprise to you that i am thoroughly unimpressed by wood thus far although qqq games is a small example he was generally a nonfactor on offense was not particularly good defensively and took too many silly penalties losing many fights in the process and gathering qqq penalty minutes in those qqq games projecting to to qqq in an qqq season he s not ready and needs at least another season at kc where he can work on his fighting skills if nothing else his relatively small size qqq qqq qqq lbs does not give much possibility that he can survive at this stage as an enforcer .,1

some deletions well we agree on the last part one of the basic things you need to have in a statistic to be able to predict a player s performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year a player s batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year a player s ability to walk or infielder s defensive average are correlated better that is to say given their past performance in those statistics we can have a pretty good handle on how they ll do next year put in some simple information about aging and you can do even better one of the basic problems with something like clutch batting average overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero adding to the sample size does n t seem to help much as a counterexample to what you showed consider the following two players from qqq qqq non clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba maldonado qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lemon qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq if you had had these two players in qqq by your logic in those clutch situations you d bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye well in qqq maldonado hit qqq in non clutch and qqq in clutch while lemon hit qqq in non clutch and qqq in clutch before you accuse me of completely cooking the data there were qqq players who had qqq clutch at bats every year from qqq qqq according to elias as a simple measure of clutchness let s just look at clutch ba non clutch ba if you use qqq to predict qqq for those qqq players you d find that qqq of the qqq were below league average in that measure both in qqq qqq and in qqq qqq were above league average in both periods and the other qqq were above in one and below in the other if you were just flipping coins you d expect to get qqq above below in both and qqq that switched the difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment is not statisically significant btw correlating players _ overall _ batting average from qqq with qqq gives a correlation coefficient of qqq which is significant at something better than the qqq confidence level correlating their clutch non clutch ba for the same period gives a correlation of qqq significant at no level of any interest actually it s technically incorrect to say that we ca n t predict future clutch performance it s more correct to say that we ca n t predict future clutch performance with any skill harold,0

well obp is the most important offensive statistic and by a big margin qqq points of obp is worth considerably more than qqq points of slugging that being said i still think baerga was very slightly better last year but i think this is as close to a wash as you re likely to find i personally do n t care much for alomar s defense i do n t think he s nearly as good as people make him out to be and he ca n t turn the dp to save his life he comes across the bag improperly and his release is slow considering the high leverage of the dp this is a shortcoming i ca n t overlook in the long term i d move alomar to another position if the jays could trade a hot devon white for something i ll be alomar could be a hell of a cf in the long run i think i d rather have jeff kent at qqq and alomar in cf than alomar white .,0
the best one i saw last year was willie mcgee off matthews i think in phillie a fierce line drive that was still rising when it hit the second deck facade at the vet willie mcgee had one homerun last year .,0
me too rbi are a worthless stat of course so is stolen bases because sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run and of course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases so batting average slugging and obp out too hmmm i guess homers would not count then either my point rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is and no stat or lack of can tell me there are no clutch hitters maybe no stat can tell me either but some people are i just know it qqq,0
it seemed pretty conclusive to me the puck clearly hit the crossbar and then came down on the line and the announcers admittedly homers kept harping about how they must have had a different view upstairs because it was obvious to them and i would have thought to anyone who saw the replay that the puck did n t go in the referee originally signalled no goal but the video replay judges initiated contact with the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored this to me is unheard of seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about the leaf chances this year cordially as always rm,1
does any one out there listen to wfan for those of you who do not know what i am talking about it is an all sports radio staion in new york on a clear night the signal reaches up and down the east coast in particular i want to know how len berman and mike lupica s show is i go to school in virginia so i ca n t listen when there are on during the day just wondering jonathan alboum uva,0
please pardon my ignorance if this is well known but what is the current rule maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make and award a balk if he exceeds it i d have another question who would operate the pitch clock one of the umpires add another one to the crew i m not sure i like this idea i think it would severely diminish the number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play one of my personal favorites ahhh i suppose i should read the whole article before i hit the f key eh obviously from what i wrote above i like this idea it may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag since the pitcher knows he does n t have very many chances to pick off the runner so he may hurry too much i d rather see runs scored as the result of sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness that could result from this kind of rule so i suppose there are some disadvantages to that idea too i remember in little league if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter s box even for a moment we were automatically out that may be a little harsh for the majors but seriously how about putting a limit on the batters being able to step out take several dozen practice swings pound their shoes scratch their balls etc maybe forcing them to stay in the batter s box would n t be such a bad idea that could save a few minutes .,0
stuff deleted i agree with the flavor of this post but disagree with one specific argument that has great hands means nothing it seems to me that a first baseman s defensive value is not entirely or even primarily from his ability to field grounders or catch popups how many such chances does he get during a game many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from qqq qqq and p i mean the total of these is much higher than grounder popup totals this implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well even if they are high up the line or in the dirt good hands are needed for such plays and thus have value i do n t have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays but i d guess that the values of these abilities are similar it s just like you do n t judge catcher s defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups but not as marked i suppose .,0
i hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of wfan and wip i go to school in philadelphia and i listen to both stations on a consistant basis now that the fan has mike lupica on from qqq to noon they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews and not just of local importance he did have dave cheketts and fred wilpon on his show but he had bob costas and magic johnson on too now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent morning show in my opinion i think imus is much better than bruno cataldi and morganti even though i would feel different if morganti had a better crew of people to work with to me wip tries to copy imus but make it all sports as a theme in terms of sports imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves but he interjects humor and politics into his show qqq am to qqq noon i think chuck cooperstein and lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show but i think chuck has the advantage over lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round lupica and the other hosts on fan get better interview guests but i heard the pd of wip say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story i would consider this even because they are two different styles of host qqq noon to qqq pm at this point i would have to give a big advantage to jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks i just think jm has the ability to transcend the homer mentality of the philadelphia fan base this is most evident when the iggles philadelphia spelling play the cowboys because jm is a huge dallas fan where else can you have people call up and predict a qqq qqq score without the egging of the hosts re wip morning guys i do agree that jm was great on the fan weekend overnight and i miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts i feel that jm is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin if you are in ny and you ca n t get wip jm does fill in on the weekends sometimes qqq to qqq this is the time when jm goes up against francesa and russo fatso and froot loops and i become the most divided in my loyalties mike and the dog are very entertaining but they often go an hour or so without calls or even qqq to qqq minutes without talking about sports matd do get great guests and that is the basis for their show so it is like the qqq to qqq debate another plus is the appearances by mike and chris on imus in the morning which are often hilarious qqq pm to qqq pm matd go up against fredericks and missanelli i like mike missanelli but i just ca n t stomach steve fredericks i know that sf came from philly originally but when he was at the fan he was a ny homer as much as he is a philly homer now i do n t listen to wip much after qqq pm unless there is a game on that night but you will see later for the reason that is why i give the advantage to fan qqq pm to midnight s m are on wip until qqq and then it is the man who makes eli that calls matd all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism g cobb this man is so grating on my nerves that if i listen to him for a few minutes i go nuts i know that is biased but listen to his show on fan there is usually a game on knicks rangers mets jets or st john s basketball if the game is on the west coast then it is usually howie rose of course i think dead air would be better than g cobb on wip but wip does air sixers and flyers games during the season if this is the sports station why did they lose the iggles to wysp home of howard stern in phil during the summer it is all talk on wip overall i would have to give the advantage to wfan with the exception of qqq to qqq and qqq to qqq where it is even and qqq to qqq where wip has the advantage rich,0

it depends on which uniforms you are talking about for the last couple of years i believe toronto and pittsburgh has used the same uniforms or at least very similar the home jerseys had the team nick name blue jays or pirates but the road jerseys had the name of the city toronto or pittsburgh i believe this is the way most teams design their uniforms .,0

uh right you also forgot that you ca n t get an rbi barring a hr with nobody on base what fraction of all runs come on solo hr most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the batter did something good i use the phrase happened to be advisedly lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the most ability to turn it up a notch in clutch rbi whatever situations and what they ve found is that there is no evidence that anyone has such an ability to any measurable extent there are no clutch hitters people who tend to do things that would cause an rbi if there were somebody on base end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by being in position i agree .,0
my votes fwiw team mvp pat verbeek he fans on qqq of goal mouth feeds but he still has qqq goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary sp team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons honorable mention nick kypreos and mark janssens probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than mvp but kypreos qqq goals qqq pim has been the hardest working player on the team and janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker i guess i place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value biggest surprise geoff sanderson he had qqq goals and qqq points last season as a center then moved to left wing and has so far put up qqq goals and qqq points he now has a new whaler record qqq power play goals most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle his garden spot honorable mention andrew cassels and terry yake the kiddie quartet of sanderson poulin nylander and petrovicky have been attracting the most attention but cassels is just qqq and will score close to qqq points this season he has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with sanderson yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still qqq and will put up about qqq goals and qqq points this season yake like sanderson started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing although lefty sanderson went to the left wing and righty yake went to the right side biggest disappointment hands down john cullen cullen had a disasterous qqq point season last year his first full season after the trade cullen started the season off of summer back surgery and fell flat on his face appropriate since he spent all of his whaler career flat on his ass and whining about it cullen scored just qqq point on qqq games was a clubhouse malcontent commanded the powerplay to a qqq success percentage qqq with sanderson and sulked his way out of town worst of all his qqq year qqq m contract had three years left to run so no one would give up any more than the qqq round draft pick the maple leafs offered to hartford honorable mention steve konroyd also subpar after signing a qqq year qqq m contract eric weinrich who showed flashes of competence but overall has played poorly jim mckenzie who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now and frank pietrangelo who only seemed to play well when sean burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row .,1

matt s problem is really more ability than attitude it is n t that he s got it in his mind that he wants to swing away but rather that he s still a total sucker for the curve ball it looked for a while in qqq that he was getting better but it s still his weak point as to whether it does him any good to have bonds behind him the net stat mavens will probably tell you there s no reason that it should but if he thinks it will it might be a self fulfilling prophecy as to whether the giants lineup is optimal who knows batting bonds the team s best hitter fifth does seem to be odd but the qqq and qqq hitters are n t exactly messrs oba so they are n t giving much up there and although clark is n t the overall offensive force that bonds is he seems better suited to the qqq spot assuming of course that he starts hitting one of these days .,0

a lot of teams carry qqq catchers on their qqq man roster but the qqq catcher is seldom ever used he is only insurance in case of extra innings or the qqq catcher is injured during a game so to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever why not invoke a catcher re substitution rule if the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game given this rule a team would n t need qqq roster catchers the qqq catcher could be playing in aaa or be a non roster bullpen catcher .,0

was it just me or did it look like hirschbeck pointed to the qqq umpire before calling that strike i thought that s why gant was asking for the appeal to the qqq base umpire he thought hirschbeck had gotten checked swing help from the wrong umpire after hirschbeck called for the pitch but before the pitch was thrown cox came onto the field it was obvious that he was trying to get time called before the pitch but no one was watching your listing pretty much agreed with what i saw with the aforementioned addendums perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark personally i was amazed that gant did n t get ejected but that s why cox did it s called protecting your players and to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game all i can say is that you d be making baseball history even in the worst baseball brawls usually only the major instigators are ejected not everyone who comes onto the field and i d have to say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game than what the braves did fri night anyhow that s my last two cents on the subject barring outrageous postings i will try to keep my eyes open for more incidents involving hirschbeck i think there will be some with other teams as well i hope not .,0

pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political office in northlands and in the business community that the oilers with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly basis they will likely have an operating loss based on normal hockey revenues and expenses that he did this was a good thing it is better he complain early and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars which would truly jeopardize the franchise pocklington s first option is not to sell or to move but to sell a minority share of the team to realize some of the appreciated value of the team and to get a better arena deal either in northlands or via a new building pocklington probably is n t going to get exactly what he wants but ultimately he will probably get enough or will sell to someone who will probably get enough there are a lot of risks in moving a team also one has to remember peter puck s principle it is better to spend other people s money than one s own if at all possible .,1

there are several reasons for this difference the main reason is that good hitters in their prime such as frank thomas and danny tartabull are rarely regular dh s even if they ca n t field it s more commonly a place to put aging veterans another use of the dh slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field i would expect such players to hit worse as dh s than they did during the rest of the season a third factor is that most player who split time between dh and first or the outfield do n t hit as well as dh s for some reason reggie jackson was a good example in five years as a rf dh for the angels he hit like the old reggie when he was in right the second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only a player who plays qqq games in right and qqq at dh will count only in the right fielders averages this makes sense you might also look at it another way although the average offensive performance of a dh may be lower than for a left fielder the replacement level offensive performance is certainly lower if you are a left fielder but ca n t hit well enough to keep a job anywhere then you certainly ca n t hit well enough to keep a job at dh .,0

i think that you are incorrect roger patrick smythe and adams all played or coached in the league before becoming front office types hence they did help build the league although they were not great players themselves i agree that a name is a name is a name and if some people have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like a reasonable idea if we can get people in the arena door by being uncomplicated then let s do so once we have them they will realize what a great game hockey is and we can then teach them something abotu the history of the game no i would not want to see a ballard division but to say that these owners are assholes hence all nhl management people are assholes would be fallacious conn smythe for example was a classy individual from what i have heard also is n t the point of professional hockey to make money for all those involved which would include the players what i think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult in the form of lesser recognition to injury less money than was deserved .,1

i ve only ever seen this called once back around qqq qqq i think that steve carlton was pitching on the other hand i am not sure how much effect this would have it seems that most of the time lost is when there are runners on base and the rule does not cover this i have wondered why a pitcher is given qqq pitches when he enters the game let s be serious the relief pitcher has normally been throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes does he really need qqq more pitches ?,0

oh yea and chris bosio pitched a no hitter one over the minimum two bases on ball in the first inning one runner left qqq pitches i listened to the game on radio and listening to dave niehaus call the game was a real treat as long as they keep ron fairly quite i doubt if anyone is better than niehaus but that fairly guy is really annoying me but i guess if clemens or viola had been pitching it would have been a different story two shutouts in two nights against the hottest best hitting team in major league baseball pretty impressive in any league man if johnson bosio and hanson keep going the mariners could be a really interesting team to follow this year also john cummings rookie has had three solid outings with no support if fleming comes back this may be the best starting staff in the american league this year relief is another story though grimace too cool the first no hitter that i have been able to follow from start to end and again i think niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the game the guy is truly a joy to listen to he deserves a pennant race .,0

tim shippert recently posted summaries of last year s defensive average stats in terms of the linear weights estimated run value of defensive performances compared to league average i ve combined those with my position adjusted mlv numbers to come up with first approximation total run values for players last year we can use these as a springboard for reconsideration of the mvp award major caveats these numbers include no defensive park adjustment so if san diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the infield that will cause some inaccuracies the offensive numbers are position adjusted but not park adjusted so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair finally we still do n t know what to do about catchers and i have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions of tony phillips and bip roberts having said that there are still some surprises let s look national league first all numbers in total runs contributed over the season player offense defense total sandberg qqq qqq qqq bonds qqq qqq qqq walker qqq qqq qqq justice qqq qqq qqq daulton qqq qqq larkin qqq qqq qqq grace qqq qqq qqq as i see it these are the legitimate mvp candidates from last season if you deflate sandberg s offense a wee bit for playing in wrigley you get essentially a dead heat had bonds been his usual defensive self it would n t have been close but that apparently was n t the case darren daulton needs qqq or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference and i could n t tell you whether that s easy or impossible a good case could be made for any of sandberg bonds or daulton as top dude my personal vote bonds sandberg daulton walker justice in the american league player offense defense total ventura qqq qqq qqq martinez qqq qqq qqq b anderson qqq qqq qqq thomas qqq qqq qqq r henderson qqq qqq qqq raines qqq qqq qqq tettleton qqq qqq ok let s see a show of hands how many of you picked robin ventura as top player in the al last year i certainly did n t but i d have a hard time arguing against him at this point yes i know these numbers are only approximate but that s a big gap between him and the qqq guy also those of you who thought rickey henderson stank last year are out of your minds once again there s a catcher in the ointment if calling a game is as important as it might be qqq runs is easy to make up or give away take a guess folks i do n t think we can do any better than that my personal vote excluding pitchers ventura tettleton anderson martinez henderson i m a big frank thomas fan but i have to admit to a bias in favor of balanced offensive defensive contribution which should have a higher leverage in w l record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with negative defense for the record carlos baerga qqq qqq qqq roberto alomar qqq qqq qqq forget it it s a wash let me also take this opportunity to admit that i was grossly wrong regarding don mattingly s defense this past season don recovered brilliantly from his weak qqq and qqq to end up with mattingly qqq qqq qqq runs which is clearly an above average first baseman however it s still qqq runs behind mark mcgwire qqq runs behind frank thomas and qqq runs behind john olerud on the other hand it s ahead of rafael palmeiro cecil fielder and every other al first baseman not yet mentioned .,0

well when you say without morris you have to mention an assumed replacement if the alternative to morris was letting cito gaston soft toss the ball underhand to the opposition every qqq days then of course the blue jays would n t have won without morris if the alternative was replacement level then i think it would ve been very close and yes morris might ve made the difference if the alternative was frank viola the blue jays probably would have won more easily with viola yes you can make the argument that the his presence prevented the team from collapsing in august those innings were probably helpful well i think is complete bs what happened most of the time is that morris fell behind and the team came back and rescued him mostly this is because he s a lousy qqq inning pitcher and much better the rest of the way that the team can climb out of qqq qqq qqq qqq holes consistently and win them qqq qqq is not to morris credit it s to the team s credit furthermore while morris did exceed the w l percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support he has n t done this in previous years in fact his w l record in qqq is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed do you think he just came up with this ability in qqq look at the qqq postseason games he pitched decently in typical morris games morris gets behind team rescues him he s not responsible for that rescue and in both those games the team just did n t rescue him enough jack morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those qqq games the offense just did n t earn him a victory morris is one of those guys who will reture when he ca n t start anymore he s too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen .,0

add boston s qqq as the bruins flagship station you probably wo n t pick it up anywhere outside of boston since it s only a qqq watt station the bruins also have network stations in all qqq new england states this could be the bruins last year on eei which also happens to be an all sports radio station the problem is that the bruins are not too happy being moved over to a different station wmex qqq whenever there is a the same night conflict with the nba s boston celtics this happened qqq times during the course of the regular season the celtics own financially troubled weei the bruins might resurface on whdh qqq next year stay tuned .,1

he s a canadian thing former coach of the boston bruins and colorado rockies from the summaries that get posted i gather that his ongoing beef this year has been the conventional wisdom that canadian hockey is doomed to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the u s and european programs after he left the rockies he got a job with cbc s hockey night in canada and has n t looked back since actually he did work for cbc at least on playoff season after the rockies were eliminated i d say it s a combination of flame bait and serious journalism the closest thing you ll find to cherry in the u s is stan fischler a self described hockey maven the similarities are that they both say things that get people upset the difference is that cherry knows the game and fischler does n t don s a character if he were completely rational and noncontroversial he would n t have a job by some definitions he could be called an ass but then some people feel the same about mike lang another character that i wish would get wider exposure only one national telecast last year .,1
unfortunately that is the way the league is heading you ca n t fight so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when the ref is n t looking ulf has brought this to a high level players stuck in the past like neely who prefer fights to cheap shots are at a disadvantage in the new system lets face it a cheap shot like high sticking is a very effective method it is easier to hide from the refs has a better chance of causing injury and you can draw people into fights that way i do n t like it but that s the way the league is going by the way there was a rather good hit by ulf in the last penguin devil game managed to hit the nj player in the face with a stick must have been a legal hit after all ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do things like that are there any ex nhl hockey players out there who might care to comment on this and end this ridiculously long discussion ?,1

actually it was in the third period his return did bring a spark to the crowd and to the players who played awesome defense in the third you forgot about gretzky if any of these guys start scoring the kings will be unstoppable if they continue the great defensive work as well stauber will be in net on tuesday hopefully he will provide another stellar performance and earn the name robb stopper stauber i believe this is how they are i know it is gretzky and sandstrom but he has been putting a number of people on left also the carson robataille kurri line once ignited will light the fire of the other lines hopefully it is evident that the scoring drought is getting to luc after his slight breakaway in the third i think he was steamed on the bench this emotion might help him break his streak also i have noticed blake has had a few really good chances to score but has fanned or shot wide is the injury still affecting him the e d g e,1
the real way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the following schedule of bonuses to players on both teams for all players who participated in the game offer qqq for each qqq minutes less than qqq hours the game took i e if the game only took qqq hours each player gets a bonus of qqq for all pitchers throwing qqq or more full innings in the game extrapolate the number of pitches or attempted pickoffs to the number they would have thrown in a full qqq innings and offer qqq for each number less than qqq if the pitcher throws a complete game with qqq pitches and qqq throws to first he would get qqq i suspect you could finance this the same way presidential campaigns are paid for offer each fan a checkoff on his or her ticket that says i want qqq of the price of this ticket to go towards fast game bonuses .,0
a dominican b not all that light hitting qqq lifetime qqq or so in qqq qqq when he did most of his playing c professional pinch hitter after that yes that also gives you jerry hairston beginning qqq year now good one not the same thing lots of people are bad ofs not all that light either qqq ops not qqq year qqq this year not qqq not qqq yup ok qqq this year six year this year brock coleman and wilson were hot dog basestealers also lonnie smith that seems to be a special class cfs like pettis and wilson also get more of a break especially if they actually do field well and brock was n t all that bad a hitter either not until the end there when he spoiled his ifetime qqq ba and again i suspect thatthe problem is lessening over time but if you look at the history of the last three decades there seems to be a clear race based pattern by which utility players and platoon players and lesser talents stayed in the ml far longer if they were white light hitting qqq hr qqq lifetime ops mainly with houston also latin btw come back in qqq and we ll party h h h h h talk .,0

here is something crossposted from the ahl mailing list in a discussion between me and chris lerch the subject of springfield s qqq round upset of the providence bruins came up chris basically raised the possibility that the ahl hierarchy is biased in favor of the indians he noted that the offices for the league are in spring and many ex indians are working for the ahl furthermore he also informed me that back a few years ago in the cup finals between roch and spring that the amerks charged favoritism by the office and that there were little questionable things liket he ahl president and staff attending all games with the springfield brass including sitting in their box for the game in springfield and according to the rochester media openly cheering for springfield certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this is true i do n t know if this is anything more than whining on the part of the amerks they have pulled this sort of crap against the wings before but if true this is somthing that seriously raises questions about president jack butterfield s leadership btw this was posted with the permission of chris,1
i am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and i can not without having stats to back up my points however i think you approached this the wrong way i believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman does i feel they were all much better players i am not saying i fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more imho dave kingman definately not they guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag the rest of his career i do not think he was very feared by pitchers i also do not think he did a lot for the game i mean really i am a met fan he was a met for part of his career and i still would not back him for the hall of fame dave winfield i think so he is feared by pitchers he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are in my opinion without stats better than kingman s probably by quite a bit i also perceive him to be a leader maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader i think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done i know some of this from when he was with the yankees i think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the hall of fame i think it deserves some consideration lee smith maybe i would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of kingman darrell evans no eddie murray maybe he has had a very good career he is a leader although a silent one he is a good role model are the stats good enough i am not sure but i would once again believe they are much better than kingman s both the average as well as the power numbers but not as good as winfield s just think eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years jeff reardon my guess is no but it kind of depends on his numbers off the top of my head i would take lee smith first well i strongly disagree here both of these guys deserve it for sure i talked about leadership above both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and ozzie has okay numbers offensively the difference with ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop he would have shattered aaron s home run mark by now how many of those great plays saved games how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game while i believe both of these guys have numbers baseball is about more than numbers or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame as does george brett who also belongs in this class of player steve garvey i am not sure probably not but i guess i could see someone making a case for him jack morris once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might bring up his name kirby puckett probably the only reason i do not say definately is he still has time left in his career if he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately nolan ryan is there really any doubt i think i heard something about him having some qqq records maybe they were not all good i do n t know i did not hear any of them just the number he has the numbers he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model i would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even top qqq but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame because of his accomplishments no hitters strikeouts respectable numbers even with some weaker teams you can go on and on i really hope he gets all the possible votes so in summing up i have qqq groups those that belong those that probably do but i am not sure and those that i lean towards saying do n t belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go yes winfield yount brett not in your mail o smith puckett and ryan maybe murray and l smith no reardon garvey morris evans and definately kingman as i said i do not have the stats around so i do not have numbers to back this up these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions .,0

like clinton and reno i accept full responsibility for this senseless disaster my wife and i picked this game to go to and thus caused the return of the pre season projected sox offense like all no no s bosio was good lucky hard grounder by vaughn off t martinez glove but straight to boone who threw to bosio at first qqq qqq qqq and backed by good defense many non trivial groundouts the game was amazingly fast as the sox tended to go down quickly and hesketh was also working fast the sox relief pitching was ok the runs off quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single which greenwell let get past him trying for a catch greenwell s mental stability is a serious concern i guess it has always been but his quirks were amusing back when he was an mvp candidate wednesday he got in a huff with johnson a after striking out on a bad inside pitch apparently johnson made an ok i ve got to stay focused gesture which iron mike interpreted as taunting and struck out to heavy booing the next two times as valentine noted last night he came up in the first after riles and quintana had walked to open the game can you say take the first pitch not mike who dribbled it into a qqq qqq qqq the pi quoted bosio that this was a batting practice fastball next time up he also hit the first pitch a hard liner straight to kgjr in center he also made the pathetic error and failed to catch boone s hr which looked comparable to the ball lance johnson caught on the highlight reel that night is riles suppsoed to be good defensively i could n t tell from the field angle but his range looked bad and he coughed a dp that cost a run or two why was he leadoff i hope fletcher gets well soon also on lineups pinella put bret boone fifth for reasons beyond me it seemed to work as he was qqq qqq with a hr and some good defense a wag behind us said he sure do n t want to go back to calgary there is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth because they ll likely lead off the second as boone did well now we face the hot angels and another power pitcher in langston a reminder that contest entries are open through next wednesday i expect a surge of pessimism by the way ties will be broken by earliest entry one entry per person or pseudonym please and easy on the pseudonyms .,0
there is a fine line between getting players input and knuckling under to players demands a manager much like a military officer needs to have his her players complete obedience and respect during a game after the game it s no big deal but when there is no time to do more than react players must trust the manager or the team often falls apart see boston red sox ff strawberry s demeanor as represented by the media often sounds like demands i suspect that a comment like i enjoy hitting fourth i m used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if it came from strawberry russ porter quoted strawberry as saying i feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and i think i perform best in that role paraphrased by my memory and bias that seems like a fairly non petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question like how do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order a more media sensitive player might answer the manager knows what he is doing if he thinks that batting me third will help the team then i am all for it we d ignore that answer as brown stuff so it seems a little bit of an overreaction to brand darryl s response as petulant personally i think his argument is nonsense and that it really does n t matter much in which order the qqq qqq players in the order are batted except for personal stats if i were darryl i d probably answer that question the number four spot gets a few more rbi opportunities and i get paid for rbis i think it is best for me to bat fourth but i am willing to hit third if tommy thinks it will benefit the team or something like that it would be helpful at salary time my rbis were down because i was hitting third and make him sound like a team player since strawberry will not likely go through arbitration but use the free agent market for his next contract maybe that argument is useless but it would help his image with the media without appearing to be totally content free .,0

it is indeed nice to have fans that are concerned about the dearth of disputatious dissertation linked to my hiatus have simply been too damned busy lately to keep you lads and lassies entertained you can be sure however that i will somehow manage to find time to woof if the leafs give just cause and let s all try to keep people s names especially mine out of the subject headers i for one neither seek nor enjoy such a cheap form of notoriety one thing you can be assured of however is this the leafs are the best of all the teams in the league that have allowed qqq goals in qqq games -,1

yes he does but the goalie sure as hell does n t want him there when i played roller hockey boy do i miss those days as a goalie i would scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot i do n t care if he s in the crease or not get him the hell away from me so i can see the ball yes roller hockey remember and if there was nobody around to clear the slot then i d do it myself by pushing the offending player hard i hate people in my way when i m the goalie and i am sure felix does too i should say that i did n t see the incident so if potvin really swung the stick big time then that s not right but he can move people out of the way he s a player on the ice too you know ),1

the flyers team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the spectrum sunday night and dominated the maple leafs thoroughly en route to a qqq qqq shutout tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the flyers defense kept the leafs from mounting any serious attack injuries pelle eklund is day to day with a bruised thigh roster moves jason bowen was added to the lineup for his first nhl game jason was the flyers second pick in the first round qqq overall of the qqq entry draft qqq years old qqq qqq lbs in qqq games with the tri city americans he had qqq goals qqq assists and qqq pim he plays left wing and defense he played defense in this game although bobby taylor said that bill dineen was planning to use him up front as well andre faust was returned to hershey he actually left after the second period of the kings game flew to albany got the game tying goal in a bears ot win and played again for hershey sunday night lines fedyk lindros recchi beranek brind amour dineen lomakin butsayev conroy acton brown galley mcgill yushkevich cronin carkner hawgood bowen tommy soderstrom in goal acton replaced lomakin in the qqq period game summary if the flyers played like this every night they d be in the playoffs this year the flyers hit everything that moved they created scoring chance after scoring chance they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of taking the shot he found brind amour crashing the net on the other side a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppa s body should have been a goal but puppa made a great save reading the play garry galley gave the maple leafs qqq ranked power play the first chance when he hooked doug gilmour at qqq the flyers lowly qqq ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill the maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept away every rebound after the power play the flyers got a goal on an ugly play rod brind amour gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the net puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef beranek and bob rouse who were wrestling in the slot beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over puppa for a qqq qqq flyers lead at qqq the flyers kept the pressure on and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers from building on their lead for a while eventually things settled down and defense prevailed each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies were strong bowen started giving some lindros like checks in his own corners then lindros who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him thought he had a chance to even the score he had foligno lined up at center ice leaned into him and rode him into the center ice boards the only problem was that foligno was a little far from the boards and mike mister mcgeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at qqq the leafs could n t get anything going on the power play as the flyers were very aggressive for a change on the kill with time running out in the period recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to lindros as they approached the leaf s blue line they were in a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindros tried a backhand pass to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi but then clark checked recchi off the puck macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and went right to mcgill who had manned the point he drove it from just inside the blue line macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at qqq shots were qqq qqq flyers in the period the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk tripped up rod brind amour in his offensive zone during the power play the flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric gloved it down but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head we could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end as time was running out in the advantage lindros found galley with a pass across the goal mouth but puppa made the save the rebound kicked back to the right corner where recchi picked it up passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle and eric one timed past puppa at qqq with the assist recchi moves past bobby clarke s qqq qqq season the second best one season total for a flyer at qqq eric moves up to qqq all time in flyers rookie scoring with qqq points mike eastwood took down al conroy at qqq to give the flyers another chance on the power play not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with a slash at qqq not much happened on the qqq on qqq although the leafs had most of the possession the flyers smothered the leafs short power play tempers flared a little at qqq bowen and pearson got roughing minors keith acton got a bloody face dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a hooking minor at qqq to set up a qqq on qqq the replay showed that hawgood s stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell again the flyers smothered the leafs power play led by dimitri yushkevich bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball he had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the slot he made all the flyers look silly as nobody could get a stick on it and it got to gilmour at the side of the net but soderstrom stoned him the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over but did n t get anything home shots were qqq qqq flyers the flyers were content with the qqq goal lead in the third period and they decided that if tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a little the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first qqq or so minutes of the period but could n t get past puppa then the leafs got tired of lindros making road kill out of them and tempers flared qqq each for doug gilmour and lindros unsportsmanlike conduct and qqq each for glenn anderson and mcgill roughing all at qqq terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at qqq on gilmour again the flyers smothered the leafs power play at about the qqq minute mark dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through soderstrom the puck was rolling on it s side and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other seconds later rod brind amour tripped up gilmour at qqq to give the leafs another chance on the power play on the advantage after soderstrom stoned andreychuk while lying down andreychuk got the rebound through soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen they kept the pressure on but soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at qqq no punches thrown recchi got the initial minor krushelnyski baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors at qqq rouse and beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got qqq each for slashing to set up another qqq on qqq mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers zone as they were battling for the puck and while mcgill was down he ran his stick across mcgill s face the flyers were not happy with that at all qqq qqq al conroy paired up with qqq qqq berehowski and started throwing punches upward well al held his own much to the delight of the crowd each got a couple punches in before going down in a head and al got a standing o penalties eastwood qqq cross check game clark carkner qqq each berehowski and conroy qqq each fighting at qqq so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers the had no interest in stting on the lead hawgood galley and brind amour played catch until hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and blasted it past puppa at qqq that was all the fireworks tommy soderstrom would not face another shot puppa did but kept the flyers off the board qqq qqq flyers shots were qqq qqq flyers in the qqq probably the strongest game i ve seen from the flyers since the all star break shutout number qqq for soderstrom all since qqq tied for qqq most in the nhl but he s played fewer games than belfour qqq or the goalie i ca n t remember that he s tied with next up it s the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg the flyers can not be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an islander win that night in washington would be the official end flyers up to qqq points on the season in qqq games last year they had qqq points in qqq games qqq under qqq so they need at least qqq points in their last qqq games to improve on that only by percentage points qqq under in qqq is better than qqq under in qqq tragic number holds at qqq points with qqq games left the tragic number for qqq is qqq points i watched the rangers blow a qqq qqq third period lead at home to lose qqq qqq before i finished this up why qqq points instead of qqq well the flyers will win the tie breaker if they catch them whereas the islanders win tie breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie the rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the devils the pens twice the flyers and finish up with qqq games against the caps so i guess qqq place could be the goal for the team to focus on flyers team record watch eric lindros qqq goals qqq assists qqq points rookie records club

not really though i would n t personally say the most deserving candidate wins rarely does a player win roy when called up in mid season and there have been several duds in recent years but this is more a factor of mediot biases than anything else i wonder if amaral hits like he is capable of will he receive roty votes he s only qqq he could have a long career ahead of him i think they are a second division team they should finish ahead of the royals mariners and possibly athletics but i do n t think they ll be above qqq i think the east is stronger this year last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible this year their offense is better but their pitching is still pretty bad even if finley returns to form he wo n t replace what they lost in abbott sanderson farrell i do n t believe it and while their ba may be good and they have decent speed their offense lacks punch they do n t have any bona fide power hitters salmon snow davis and curtis none with more than qqq hr potential cheers valentine,0

one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and has n t yet been addressed i believe the rule also does not deal with this situation if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught runners can tag up and advance at their own risk as on any fly ball however if the infield fly is not caught at what point can a runner legally leave his base w o fear of being doubled off for advancing too early when the ball hits the ground when a fielder first touches the ball after it hits the ground enlightenment would be appreciated .,0
it was unlikely improbable for the bruins it was the stuff of nightmares for the sabres it was a taste of heaven for the first time since qqq the sabres have won the first three games of a series last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the canadiens it takes a little more work this time the sabres seem ready to put in the extra work on the heels of a shutout one that took away boston s home ice advantage the sabres came back with a four to three overtime win it was n t easy it was n t always pretty it still worked john blue got the nod for boston supplanting andy moog as starting goaltender moog was pulled midway through game qqq on tuesday buffalo started with a goal by mogilny his fourth of the playoffs on the powerplay with boston s don sweeney and gord roberts in the box lafontaine and hawerchuk had the assists goal number two was khmylev s first of the playoffs a pretty goal scored when the sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting khmylev smehlik and hannan assisted determined not to be shut out boston tallied on a shot by ray bourque on the powerplay with colin patterson and bob sweeney both in the box period two was scoreless a split of penalties between the two clubs the third saw boston s smolinski get his first courtesy of oates buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later from former bruin bob sweeney khmylev and carney neely tied the game qqq of the way through the third sending it into overtime last year overtime meant a bruin win last night it spelled sweet revenge as buffalo scored with ray bourque in the penalty box on a tip in by khmylev hawerchuk and lafontaine a minute into overtime both teams finished with qqq shots power play conversions boston qqq qqq buffalo qqq qqq referee rob shick comments shick pocketed the whistle in the third allowing a lot of clutching and grabbing buffalo s penalty killing unit was fantastic again mogilny was checking granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards but checking like this is a novel idea to mogilny the crowd was unbelievable i do n t think i ve ever heard a crowd that loud in the aud for a sabres game remember i was only five when they played for the cup i do n t remember it and no one took me to the games doug bodger in a postgame interview noted that he tried to say something to hawerchuk but the crowd was too loud even though he was shouting it did n t seem to matter as most of the sabres and even muckler said it was great yuri khmylev did n t seem to realize that he was the game s third star and did n t skate out when his name was called sweeney qqq and fuhr qqq each were out before yuri made his appearance sans jersey when asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was he responed yes ok it was through an interpreter and he said more than that even more than the interpreter said but i digress the interviewer seemed to think just because he does n t speak english he must not understand playoffs uh huh .,1
in four of the five games finns have played the goalie has been chosen the best player of the opposing team in the fifth the finnish goalie ketterer was elected the best finn has this to do with the goalies having good days in these games or are the finnish players just lousy scorers anyway quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally the exception of course being canada vs italy it looks like the goalies are getting too good is this due to their equipment getting bigger so they cover more their gloves e g seem to be much bigger now than they were some years ago anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way mikko wihervaara,1

imho this is the most untrustworthy silly stat by today s rules in all of baseball my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher can not pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least appear in the on deck circle also the lead a pitcher enters with can not excede three runs i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in determining winners savers etc for instance a pitcher can come in in the ninth with a lead blow the lead fall behind have his team come back in the next half inning and earn the win has this pitcher earned a win no way i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his teammates rally to tie the score assume he came in to start the fourth and left after the eighth his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win the third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat satisfaction mike,0

did anyone notice the words not for baseball printed on the picture of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa today any reason given for this also i just noticed something looking at the nolan ryan timeline in the preview on qqq rickey henderson became nolan s qqq strikeout on qqq he pitched his qqq no hitter against oakland i believe the last out in the game was made by rickey henderson and on qqq nolan pitched his qqq no hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his qqq base which overshadowed it it seems that nolan is having a lot of publicity at rickey s expense imo rickey deserves it and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what i ve seen on it lately they are both great players but imo nolan has outclassed rickey both in playing and more importantly in attitude just my thoughts .,0

uh gerald i think he was joking .,1
is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad i ca n t remember how many times during the penguins devils game they showed some guy without the puck being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal in fact i think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner now the last time i watched a football game they did n t show the lineman going at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown is it just me ?,1
just heard on the news that mike keenan formerly of the blackhawks flyers and general of a siberian prison has just signed to coach the rangers the rangers who won the president s cup last year have slipped just a bit at the end of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly flyers the flyers fans are going to be disappointed on keenans decision because they were very interested in him oh well go caps connin,1

the flyers blew a qqq qqq lead over the buffalo sabres in the second period but kevin dineen s qqq career hat trick powered them to their qqq consecutive win qqq qqq over the sabres who have now lost qqq in a row alexander mogilny led the comeback scoring his qqq and qqq goals of the season which tied the game at qqq in the qqq period and qqq in the qqq tommy soderstrom stopped qqq of qqq shots on goal to improve his own record to qqq qqq qqq as he was tested by mogilny and lafontaine all night roster move andre faust was once again recalled from hershey shawn cronin was a healthy scratch lines eklund lindros recchi beranek brind amour dineen lomakin butsayev conroy faust acton brown galley bowen yushkevich hawgood carkner mcgill tommy soderstrom game summary say if anybody from buffalo is reading this where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems we had to turn down the volume the flyers defense started out the game showing everybody why the flyers have been shutting teams out lately by holding the sabres to only qqq shots in the first period they then showed everybody why they will be playing golf sunday when they gave up qqq shots in the last two periods maybe tommy told them that he was getting bored back there mark recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it after buffalo won the faceoff and dumped tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to eric qqq way up on his left eric dropped it to galley and he sent it ahead to recchi steaming out of the zone mark skated into the center circle passed the puck to himself through the legs of richard smehlik skated around him and in on fuhr smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick recchi drifted right drifted back left and slid the puck back to the right past fuhr for a qqq qqq flyers lead at qqq it was so beautiful eric and garry should turn down their assists the flyers kept the pressure on fuhr for a while after that but he was strong and kept the flyers from doing further damage the game then became a defensive struggle for a while the sabres got the first chance on the power play when terry carkner took a boarding minor at qqq for crunching dale hawerchuk into the boards in the flyers zone lafontaine got the only scoring chance and not a terribly good one as the flyers smothered the sabres power play mogilny got a post after it was over the qqq consecutive penalty kill for the flyers keith carney took a holding penalty at qqq for taking down mark recchi to give the flyers a power play the best penalty killing team in the league did n t allow the flyers a shot on goal although the flyers did create a good scoring chance for lindros who partially fanned on his shot towards the end of the period the play started going end to end but everybody kept missing the net greg hawgood took an interference penalty at qqq to give the sabres another power play but they could n t get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure particularly when they iced the puck shots were qqq qqq buffalo after the flyers had led qqq qqq at one point mike emrick interviewed flyers president jay snider between periods jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs but not discouraged this was considered a rebuilding year after the trade and he seemed very happy with the way the season went when asked if he agonized over the trade he said that it was russ farwell s trade and not his that it only was an issue for him and ed snider as far as the money but yes there was some agonizing and they d do it all over again when asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it s russ call and russ will evaluate things at the end of the season he feels that they re qqq years away from a shot at the cup he expects to get into the playoffs next year have a shot at a division title the following year and a shot at the finals the year after that this based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer he s very happy with the re alignment he called it outstanding happy with the current expansion feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of europeans but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable seemed to like the idea of playing in the olympics booo but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus the sabres gave the flyers their second power play of the game when brad may took a tripping penalty at qqq of the second the flyers had a little trouble getting started but eventually did hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to eklund just outside the sabres blue line along the right boards eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle he half fanned on it and sent the puck trickling through the slot fuhr did n t know where it was though and hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at qqq then mogilny on a breakaway he slipped through two flyers at the blue line and went in on soderstrom he went with the backhander but soderstrom was all over it the flyers then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them viacheslav butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor then according to gary dornhoefer took a dive to get the other there was no video at qqq the sabres coudln t get started ryan mcgill poked at the puck just after a sabre carried into the flyers zone and after a bunch of people poked at it dineen emerged with it and headed the other way it started out a qqq on qqq but brind amour hustled ahead to make it a qqq on qqq and back off the defenseman dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it qqq qqq flyers at qqq that was all for fuhr john muckler sent in dominik hasek to take over but the sabres still had lots of power play time again they took some time to just get into the flyers zone and when they finally did the flyers were all over them boos began to ring through the building but they finally got through soderstrom on an ugly goal smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to hawerchuk in the slot hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as galley dove down to block it mistake qqq he should have let soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about a the rebound or b barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net well the rebound dropped right next to soderstrom and mistake qqq galley just laid there and watched barnaby get three hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie he did n t even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away with the goal at qqq two streaks end for the flyers qqq of shutout hockey and qqq straight penalty kills lindros put them right back on the power play at qqq with a high sticking minor i think it was barnaby again this time the sabres were able to get set up quickly but could n t get too much quality on goal the sabres continued to keep the puck in the flyers end for a while after the power play ended things evetually settled down but then the other very bad penalty mcgill allowed barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff the gloves were dropped and mcgill started pounding the crap out of him but during the fight he gave barnaby a head butt with his helmet and that meant a match penalty qqq for slashing qqq fighting and qqq for the major qqq minutes of power play time for the sabres at qqq barnaby only got qqq the flyers were keeping them at bay for a while but there was only so long they could do that after a couple of good sabre chances audette handed to ledyard at the point and ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by soderstrom lafontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net and knocked it over to randy wood at the right soderstrom had moved over to play lafontaine and since yushkevich and carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men wood just slid it into the empty net at qqq to close the flyers lead to qqq qqq lafontaine was actually trying to put it on net but half fanned on it and got a break the flyers then got some shorthanded pressure in the sabres zone but hasek was strong finally it was keith carney passing ahead to hawerchuk into the neutral zone and hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to mogilny at the flyers blue line another mini breakaway for mogilny he elected to shoot from the left circle and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at qqq for his qqq of the season ironically the youth hockey tip between the qqq and second period was tommy soderstrom talking about cutting off angles that was all in the qqq shots were qqq qqq sabres into the qqq period and pelle eklund blew a golden opportunity to get the flyers the lead back a qqq on qqq acton with the puck he dropped to eklund in the slot and eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from when he finally did shoot he hit the far post that was still during the carryover power play time than an incredible almost goal randy wood skated around recchi and hawgood untouched into soderstrom soderstrom goes down wood pokes the puck under soderstrom and a black object hits the back of the net red light comes on horn sounds crowd cheers but up to the video replay booth for some strange reason and in the meantime emrick and dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing well it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net not the puck emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net dave hannan then took out recchi and got a holding minor at qqq the flyers could not get anything going at all they finally got set up qqq way through but were kept on the perimeter as time ran out beranek stripped the puck from a sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to eklund at the top of the left circle eklund saw dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him dineen fumbled the pass but twice directed it at hasek and eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his qqq at qqq qqq qqq flyers but the sabres came right back lafontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to bob erry behind the flyers net erry started to skate out but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net mogilny flew in skated around and stuffed it through soderstrom s qqq hole for his qqq at qqq to tie the game at qqq then hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at qqq the flyers set up in the sabres zone and stayed there off a faceoff high in the sabres zone in the middle while brind amour wrestled for the puck dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to hasek s glove side at qqq play started to go back and forth until hawgood took a roughing penalty at qqq the flyers dumped the puck into the sabres zone brind amour and ledyard went after it and rod got the puck he backed away from the right boards skated to the right faceoff dot and passed between his legs to dineen crashing through the slot all by himself dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of hasek for a qqq qqq flyers lead at qqq qqq hat trick of the season for dineen qqq of his career qqq shorthanded goal of the game for him qqq of the season then carney took a tripping penalty at qqq to kill the rest of the sabres power play not much action on the qqq on qqq and the sabres got most of the chances on the flyers resulting power play play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves the sabres were n t able to pull hasek as time was running out as the flyers would n t allow any consistant possession for the sabres finally as time was running out ken sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and brind amour stripped it away from him he pulled away and found dineen on the other side of the left circle and dineen found acton at the right of hasek he slid the puck between two sabres defenders and acton chipped it back to the far side of hasek for his qqq of the season at qqq on his qqq birthday that was all the scoring shots were qqq qqq buffalo and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who had n t been tested much in his last couple of starts kevin dineen has a career high qqq point night unless he had a better night earlier in the season but i do n t think so the flyers longest winning streak in qqq years qqq goals for only qqq against with three shutouts eric lindros is qqq in league with qqq even strength goals despite missing qqq games with injury qqq points out of qqq clinched qqq place since the rangers lose the tie breaker a couple misc notes forget the mike keenan rumors there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the new york rangers next year in the last notes i mentioned that garry galley won the barry ashbee award but i failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman the times of trenton has reported that a preeminent specialist from oklahoma has looked over tommy soderstrom s medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future same paper had a blurb about bill dineen

it s me again !,0
this is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division but the giants are going to need every break they can get if they want too hold that lead i do n t think they can afford to be lackadaisical and say well it has worked pretty well so far and while we might be able to improve the results we do n t think it is worth the risk the two tend to go hand in hand .,0
i d like to echo these sentiments this is the worst coverage i can ever remember seeing on cbc as soon as the game ends i can count to qqq and by that time they ve signed off the air no post game interviews no updating of late scores nothin tsn is really putting cbc to shame i only hope the later round coverage improves i mean who really wants to see cbc primetime news instead of hockey my qqq darren,1
above robinson s average the easliy real stats water boy tons check your facts andre dawson s career slugging pct is in the qqq s so is winny s i would like to see your facts winny has probably done better than qqq points above with a carrer slg of qqq check on more important stats defense and heart batting average rbi s,0
then allow me to enlighten you rex you see there s a thing called a tie a tie is worth one point i know i know you re not good at math but bear with me a win is worth two points so getting two ties is the same as getting one win if your team played two games won one and lost one you d have two points if my team played two games and tied them both we d also have two points we d be tied in the standings even though our records are different perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again i am starting to sound like roger or what ),1

"here in nanaimo on vancouver island for you furriners out there we got the abc coverage on komo it probably depends on your cable company i started off switching between the cbc and abc broadcasts but finally settled on abc i ca n t stand don whitman and al michaels was doing a decent job he followed the play pretty well knew all the players names and only made a couple of rookie mistakes that i noticed one thing that surprised me is that they never once attempted to explain the offside rule am i paranoid or is this really happening department there were no fights in the game but there were a couple of occasions where it looked like a fight was about to start both times abc cut away to show a closeup of a coach or mcnall or something has abc decided to adopt the spicer policy """,1

i think most of the problems mainly arose from manager gene mauch s ineptitude in managing the pitching staff down the stretch he abused jim bunning chris short and robin roberts i think those are the three pitching each on only qqq days rest for quite some time by the time they hit the last qqq weeks of the season obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm oh well roberts was long gone he was probably an oriole in qqq or maybe a colt qqq the qqq starter was art mahaffey the previous year s ace dennis bennett was the qqq starter they were indeed qqq up with qqq to go but they won their final two games after the horrid qqq streak the final game victory bunning s qqq win if memory serves kept the reds from tying for the title they and the phils were both qqq game behind the cards with the giants another game back the mets could n t hold an early lead against the cards that final sunday or there would have been a qqq tie too bad they could n t have saved some of the qqq or so runs they scored on saturday when they crushed st louis -,0

it s not a cliche and unlike your comments below it s not a tautology it need n t have been true if every pitcher in baseball were essentially the same in quality i e if the variance of pitching ability were much smaller than the variance of batting ability then scoring runs would be much more important than preventing them simply because the ability to actively prevent runs would be much weaker if that s your point you should have said so what you in fact said was pitching and defense win championships and later pitching is the essence of baseball neither of which says what you are now claiming was your point and neither of which is true and you accuse sherri of mouthing cliches it s not clear to me at all that this is true in high scoring games the team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time in low scoring games the split is essentially qqq regardless of team ability i thought you said pitching and defense win championships and pitching is the essence of baseball .,0

you want to speed up ballgames qqq enforce the two minutes between innings as it is many fields are allowing three minutes between them fifteen seconds before tv commercials are gone to thirty or so before action begins upon the return to the game two minutes last out to first pitch or a ball is called qqq do n t grant time to batters just because they want it they may get pissed at first but they ll get in line once anything the pitcher throws while they re adjusting their wristbands is a strike qqq mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches the current rule is too lenient and then enforce it fifteen seconds is more than enough time if the pitch is n t released in qqq call it a ball and restart the clock baseball games take about qqq in the nl and just a shade under qqq hours in the al that s just too damn long i do n t like to play in qqq hour games much less watch a game for that long my butt falls asleep and if i m watching on tv i ll channel surf between pitches catching colorized versions of mr ed leave it to beaver and those wacky nieporents on nick at nite .,0

writes oh probably ms nichols has given the average game times and average runs scored for qqq and qqq a very nice piece of information ms nichols who knows she may be listening and not have me in her kill file after all those numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half a run less being scored per game and the games taking qqq minutes longer something is being done now that was n t done ten years ago which is extending the games by qqq minutes ms nichols thinks it s more pitches given the increasing specialization of pitchers it would n t surprise me if it s not simply more pitches though i do n t think it s unreasonable to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back then i get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher after he comes in and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules which have been stated in other posts in this thread and other related ones the problem is who decides whether that time is wasted you do n t seem to think it is at all right now i think it is although i have heard one case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs the difference in mounds between the field and pen but who knows if the rules get changed maybe something i did n t foresee will happen to change my mind but you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing or else nothing will be changed rg,0

hey what s this we agree no platoon advantage sabo vs samuel both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with slow curves and change ups sabo has more power and a little bit of a better batting eye samuel is noted as an agressive free swinger sabo has more homerun power both players started the game hitting below qqq there may have been some game considerations that might have prompted perez to want to reserve samuel for use later but the game was on the line and samuel never did get in given all of this i do n t see a lot to suggest pinch hitting nor do i see anything to suggest no pinch hitting there is of course the clutch hitting information but if that s useless then again if it s not .,0

well it really is n t this cut and dry but as a jay fan the thing i feared worst has happened the yanks sent down williams g and are going to start williams b in cf i also believe they kept wickman and millitello in their rotation which is much nicer than that kaminiecki and mike witt combo i thought they d throw out their to the slaughterhouse because of their experience granted witt might be good but i think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters up and not given the job to witt because he was a good pitcher and has experience the yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards the jays with the loss of dave stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their pitching staff the orioles should also be there in the end .,0
espn has been trying various things to get away from the follow the puck concept of televising hockey games one of the main problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything that is going on more happens away from the puck than in any other sport except maybe football and they can do iso s on football players to be shown between plays the problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile other times you get burned .,1
was going over some videos last night studying qqq and qqq videotapes of jose canseco proved to be very interesting and enlightening here s my analysis of jose canseco circa sep qqq and jose canseco circa june qqq qqq he s bulked up too much period he needs to lose about qqq pounds not gain more bulk qqq his bat speed has absolutely vanished conservatively i d say he s lost qqq of his bat speed and that s a huge amount of speed qqq that open stance is killing him note that he acts sort of like brian downing way open to start then closes up as ball is released downing could do this without significant head movement canseco ca n t also note that canseco does n t always close his stance the same way sometimes his hips are open sometimes they re fully closed without a good starting point it s hard to make adjustments in your swing what would i do if i were jose aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch so that i d never have to work again i d restructure my entire swing first minimize movement before the swing close and widen the stance and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing hopefully this will cut down on the time i need to swing and will allow me to move the bathead more freely second drop qqq pounds cut out the weight work third relax the wrists will cost some power but until i can find my qqq stroke concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up rolling the wrists through the strike zone and hit line drives his strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park if canseco s open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems he ll be out of baseball in three years if not he could still hit qqq hr .,0

wood is fairly small for an enforcer type i mean fleury does a pretty good job and is n t that large but dody is no fleury having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup he simply is n t ready to fight at an nhl level assuming that it s his role which is all he really showed us in his few games up from k c if he can pass shoot or skate i never saw much of it all he has is a right fist which is n t bad but at the nhl level the other players are smart enough to grab the thing before he can land anything significant once you control that hand he s a fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything he wants to him his entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach until he found an opening and i never once saw him find an opening worth talking about he got neutralized quickly and stomped on a couple of times unless he shows some new tricks in camp he ll be on my career minor leaguer list since this was his first taste of the nhl i expect the sharks gave it to him so he d know what he d have to work on off season he needs to get stronger he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some versatility as something else than a simply goond because he was n t particularly good as a goon .,1

jagr has a higher but francis has had more points and take it from an informed observer ronnie francis has had a much better season than jaromir jagr this is not to take anything away from jaro who had a decent year although it did n t live up to the expectations of some bowman tended to overplay francis at times because he is a bowman style player he plays hard at all times does n t disregard his defensive responsibilities and is a good leader bowman rewarded him be increasing his ice time jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude this rubbed bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time throughout the year francis consistently recieved more ice time than jagr althouhg i have never seen stats on this subject i am pretty sure that jagr had more points per minute played that francis when you add to that jagr s better rating i think it becomes evident that jagr had a better season not that francis had a bad one actually what i think has become more evident is that you are determined to flaunt your ignorance at all cost jagr did not have a better season than francis to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of hockey knowledge save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty plus minus it is the most misleading hockey stat available until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice time per game and some measure of its quality i e is the player put out in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up against the other team s top one or two lines short handed etc i would much rather see the disappear altogether instead of having its dubious merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications thank you for posting this as the person who first brought up the fact that jagr has a much higher than francis i can assure you that i brought it up as an example of the absurdity of comparisons even on the same team i never ever thought that anyone would argue that jagr s higher actually reflected better two way play in my opinion francis s low is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times the fact that he can chip in qqq points while neutralizing the other team s top center is a testament to how valuable he is even if his suffers on the other hand jagr for how big fast and skilled he is ca n t even get qqq points no matter how inflated his is by the way do n t get me wrong i like jagr he may be a lazy floater but he turns it on at exactly the right times like overtime of playoff games .,1

hey man having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a couple of sessions of mock hockey i m ready to invest in hockey equipment particularly since i will be taking summer hockey lessons however i am completely and profoundly ignorant when it comes to hockey equipment i ve checked out local stores and looked at catalogs but i was hoping to solicit opinions suggestions before actually plunking down any money having played football in high school and college i at least have that equipment as a basis for comparison but for example what are the advantages disadvantages to different kinds of shoulder pads and pants girdles are there any notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles etc so any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated .,1

later on in your posting you make reference to putting words into other people s mouths i would suggest that your last paragraph can only be interpreted in one way namely that i along with greg claim that gainey never made a technical mistake if you actually read what i ve written you will find that i make no such claim soooo if logic serves me well you re contradicting yourself roger i m not sure here but i think ignorance is really a function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an opinion but hey if you need to take a cheap shot then by all means go ahead that s if it makes you feel better my word such vehemence against poor ol bob gainey why does he bother you so much he was an effective player for his style of play i m really sorry roger but you have lost me completely here why do n t you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ himself in nets now if you were to compare say for example bob gainey with guy carbonneau you would have a balanced comparison i m wrong again hmmm let s see where was i wrong in the first place i m only guessing here rog but i have a feeling that you ve setup a you re wrong again macro key on your machine i agree that my use of the word plugger is simplistic but i think you know what i m getting at i would also like to point out that gilmour s potential as a selke winner was never part of the debate are you asking me for an opinion if so i think there are far too many other deserving players to include gilmour among the candidates i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers grant fuhr essa tikkannen butch goring bob nystrom bob gainey doug jarvis derek sanderson wayne cashman bob baun bob pulford ralph backstrom henri richard dick duff and so on demonstrates a blanket disregard for these individuals as contributors to the game so yes settle down nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods c mon it has a nice ring to it and admit it you had a good laugh congenially as always jd james david david student business uwo ca,1

it would help if his obp were higher than his batting average yes the april qqq usa today lists le grand chapeau as having a qqq batting average and a qqq obp that s on qqq hitting with qqq zip nil nada walks the reason a lot of us are down on galarraga is that he s has a long history of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability except for drawing walks if he hit qqq for say even qqq ab s i d be convinced that there was a real change in his ability if he did it with an obp avg i d not only be amazed but i d make a bet that that would be a unique feat in the history of the game but what do qqq ab s prove look at some of the other fluke players at this point in the season player avg ab blauser qqq qqq grace qqq qqq milligan qqq qqq conine qqq qqq lansing qqq qqq slaught qqq qqq are any of these guys really that good well in a word no how significant is galarraga s average at the qqq ab level a hit is worth about qqq if he d had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good defensive play he d be in the qqq range if he goes qqq in his next game he s all the way down to qqq in one game come back in june let s talk then it s history greg andres history is that he does n t walk much because he swings at bad pitches so his average is n t very good qqq ab s does n t mean an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand especially when there s ample evidence qqq bb in qqq that his basic hitting approach has n t changed yeah he might suddenly have turned into a qqq hitter who never walks but do n t bet the rent money on it mike jones aix high end development mjones donald aix kingston ibm com,0
i have to agree wholeheartedly with this view i do n t like to see stickwork but you have to clear players away from in front my personal favorite move i m a goalie too is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref is n t looking makes em go down like a ton of bricks but does n t cause injuries unless they do n t know how to fall i m talking about hitting the blades here not the foot it also makes the player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty unfortunately it also leaves your blocker out of position for a short time i do n t do this if a shot is likely on the short side hmm maybe i should mail potvin this method in french and with helpful diagrams of course it sure would be nice to see ciccerelli who i have a great deal of respect for btw he s not a big guy but he plays huge fall on his back a few times ),1

again i assume this is not just flame bait by roger but actually a truly held opinion thanks for speaking for all those who did n t feel it was important enough to say something themselves i would n t say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that you belong to it represents a subset that you do n t belong to of a larger group which you do if only because this is n t a moderated group look there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint three that come to mind are as follows qqq say it subtly result it may not be clear qqq say it directly yet politely result probably it will spark some interesting conversation qqq say it directly and obnoxiously result validity goes right out the window you realize that anything you say can and most certainly will be used against you .,1

you started it you most certainly did sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel yet you would pinch hit samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter right i d call that predicting the future right i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past overall performance l r splits even matching hitting pitching styles all of these will give me some advantage if used properly even if all else were equal there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance and in this case everything else pointed to sabo that comes down to the same thing when perez left sabo in he was predicting the future the next ab he was predicting that sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel by supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite well yes you are aware of its existance you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling yet you rather forcefully state the opposite you do n t seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important i d say this is insulting right this is the beef it has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under any circumstances at least none that we ve been able to come up with if you know of some where it is an indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret most certainly as i have repeatedly stated if you can come up with a study which even hints at a consistent clutch ability i would love it however the straightforward attempts at such a study have all failed miserably well it was a stupid argument are you honestly debating that sure we know sabo did n t get a hit we have no idea whether samuel would have done any better or not one ab most certainly does n t prove anything is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount worse in the clutch than overall if you mean the first then as you say we ll just have to wait and see but the second is a much stronger statement in fact it suggests a rule we can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years i think you will agree that if the rule did n t work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do any better this year right i m not going to get into case analysis sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from qqq and then hit poorly in qqq as well you can also find those who hit poorly from qqq and then hit well in qqq gambler s fallacy unless there is reason to expect consistency a run proves nothing can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next i ve seen a detailed study of why i should n t expect it to correlate the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid and i do n t see how you can deny it as for total idiot yes if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong i would say the term fits nicely so tell me does the term fit or do you have an open mind ?,0

sigh here we go again must i if i were to say that batting average is a predictor that can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a hit on a particular plate appearance is that only valid if i can define the skill in hitting a baseball that s all i ve said except i used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations i did not say i could predict the future i ve suggested that the statistic is not necessarily meaningless here s the data for this situation non clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba sabo qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq samuel qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel i m sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance you just would n t have used this particular aspect of prior performance is this not correct one more time i did not claim to be able to predict the future i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo and i am not dismissing your work i m stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work i did not say that clutch hitting is well defined i said that the data is significant to me i did not say that it is a consistent skill i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances and big sigh i have not not not not not not not ever called you or anyone else on r s b stupid it is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived biases ah i knew we could get to the name calling and there s that word you like so much wait a minute i thought i first had to define clutch hitting do i or do n t i i made two statements in my post qqq i am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting qqq i would have hit for sabo as for qqq many of us make a number of written statements through this media about what we think will happen in baseball i m not shy about it i ll make the statement again i believe that by season s end that chris sabo s batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch situations i ca n t prove that it will happen so i guess we ll just have to wait and see here s another one for you in qqq qqq joe carter s batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in non clutch situations each year i presume you think this is random non clutch qqq ab qqq h qqq clutch qqq ab qqq h qqq so what could we expect in qqq from mr carter well his composite ba through qqq was qqq through qqq was qqq through qqq was qqq so i think we have a pretty good idea of what kind of batting average he can produce in qqq he hit qqq not surprising huh also in qqq non clutch qqq ab qqq h qqq clutch qqq ab qqq h qqq no this does n t prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of major league ballplayers it just makes me think that in qqq joe carter s batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in non clutch situations as for qqq above i have plenty of company john dewan of stats inc is the editor of the scouting report wherein the statistics regarding clutch hitting are compiled reported and referenced in the text bill james makes numerous references to a player s ability to hit well in the clutch i am not saying that i can predict the future any more than they are you and others are saying that your work renders their statements and mine meaningless i do n t accept that which in your words proves that i am a total idiot stupid total idiot my my such hostility the beastmaster,0

well it looks like just as doug trumped tim beating him to the net with his defensive analyses so tim has gotten in ahead of me the way i was doing it was a little different being me of course i used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth and i calculated both rate of performance fielding equivalent average and total performance fielding equivalent runs but i compared not to the average player but the replacement player and here s why because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system in the al of qqq the average ss is qqq runs above replacement rar cf qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq lf qqq rf qqq qqq qqq we may quibble with the exact numbers but the order looks substantially right in the equivalent average i have always set league average to qqq i had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of qqq the name of that replacement level hitter often as not is billy ripken i decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from qqq as qqq but in the opposite direction as i have set it up that makes for an eqa of qqq yes i can add runs are proportional to eqa squared the difference between qqq squared and qqq squared equals the difference to qqq squared and i rounded off for simplicity an all replacement fielding team would have randy milligan at first qqq willie randolph qqq at second leo gomez qqq at third walt weiss qqq at short kevin bass qqq in left hojo qqq in center and eric anthony qqq in right ugh so the total number of rar for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding rar i can rate them by total rar or rar per some number of batting outs like qqq an average player has a total rar of about qqq qqq batting qqq fielding total rar bat field qqq bonds qqq qqq ventura qqq qqq qqq sandberg qqq qqq thomas qqq qqq qqq van slyke qqq qqq anderson qqq qqq qqq grace qqq qqq raines qqq qqq qqq lankford qqq qqq puckett qqq qqq qqq pendleton qqq qqq alomar qqq qqq qqq finley qqq qqq martinez e qqq qqq qqq bagwell qqq qqq mack qqq qqq qqq butler qqq qqq mcgwire qqq qqq qqq sheffield qqq qqq griffey qqq qqq qqq larkin qqq qqq devereaux qqq qqq qqq grissom qqq qqq henderson qqq qqq qqq walker qqq qqq listach qqq qqq qqq justice qqq qqq lofton qqq qqq qqq w clark qqq qqq baerga qqq qqq qqq kruk qqq qqq qqq d white qqq qqq qqq o smith qqq qqq palmeiro qqq qqq qqq gwynn qqq qqq sierra qqq qqq qqq hollins qqq qqq carter qqq qqq qqq j bell qqq qqq gonzalez qqq qqq notable entries in a qqq batting out rating nl top qqq are bonds qqq lf sandberg qqq qqq van slyke qqq cf grace qqq qqq larkin qqq ss justice qqq rf sheffield qqq qqq one at each position measured mcgriff despite qqq batting rar fifth in league finishes out of the top qqq due to a qqq in fielding last by position galarraga qqq stillwell qqq hansen qqq belliard qqq blauser gad a qqq qqq in league may qqq dascenzo qqq anthony qqq in the al much maligned rickey henderson was worth qqq second only to frank thomas qqq ventura edges edgar at third qqq qqq grebeck rates a potent qqq griffey edges puckett as top cf qqq qqq listach nudges out lofton among rookies qqq qqq and alomar clearly outpoints baerga qqq qqq last by position segui qqq sojo qqq palmer qqq lewis qqq polonia qqq cuyler qqq v hayes qqq all for now .,0

i have n t seen enough royals games to judge his tactics so you may have a point here but imo the royals do n t have a chance to win the pennant even if mcrae suddenly began channeling for john mcgraw ok they have some decent pitchers but when your offense consists of bums like gagne and lind and mcreynolds and mcrae and an over the hill brett you re not going to finish qqq unless mcgraw brings christy mathewson back with him i d say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck .,0
well the jettison for youth fast strategy was his also in hindsight it did n t work all that well but i think it was more because it left the sharks on a tightrope without a net not that it was inherently flawed it was the injuries that caused us to fall from all indications it was n t the major factor but the last straw there were personality conflicts among shark management and disagreements over how personnel were going to be handled not just who was being traded vs kept but who was being sent to kc what ferriera did if rumors are right was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed i think if they d kept ferriera they would have lost some of their other management staff depending on which sources you trust we might have lost grillo and lombardi and murdoch over the summer frankly i want to keep those three we may well ahve also lost kingston which of course is now a moot point the sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly consensual and cooperative ferriera wanted to run things his way there were conflicts ferriera lost that says nothing about his skills or accomplishments at that level a lot is personality and politics i think he did some good things for the sharks but that he never fit in as a shark person i hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down in anaheim too because it ll be good for hockey but i want the ducks to be doormats for a couple of years so the sharks succeeed first .,1

here is a review of some of the off ice things that have affected the ahl this year st john s maple leafs problems the st john s maple leafs sophomore season has been plagued by problems on ice the leafs won the atlantic division title but off ice was less happy a strike by public workers has forced the leafs out of the newfoundland city for much of the last half of the seaosn since mid jan they have played home games in places like montreal cornwall and charlottetown their playoff home games will be played in the metro center in halifax ns one demostration got violent workers attacked a leafs bus and rocked it and broke windows in the st john s memorial stadium despite the problems toronto officials insist that the leafs will return to st john s once the strike ends senators sold the new haven senators have been sold by peter shipman to the ottawa senators nhl organization they are the only canadian nhl team with an american ahl affiliate and have made it clear they intend to move the team to somewhere in the canadian atlantic provinces this sale and move has yet to be approved by the ahl head office but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting in may the quote in the story from jack butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the ahl franchise accompanied by nhl ownership rather than maintaining the qqq history of the ahl in new haven the senators are currently in serious negotiations with charlottetown new brunswick and are expected to move there dallas helps hawks stay in moncton after announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of moncton the winnipeg jets changed their mind the jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from qqq to around a dozen and they wanted to share with an existing ahl or ihl franchise enter the dallas lone stars dallas agreed to supply the remaining qqq or qqq players to the moncton franchise thus keeping the hawks in the new brunswick city the deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over qqq the hawks only sold qqq for this year saint john flames official the calgary flames have officially signed a deal with the city of saint john nb the saint john blue flames will play in the qqq exhibition center the flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the ahl but are expected to have no trouble caps follow jacks to maine despite rumors to the contrary the capitals will follow the baltimore skipjacks to maine the caps current farm team the baltimore skipjacks announced that they would move to maine and become the portland pirates there was much doubt as to if the caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with portland they would supply a dozen or so players including qqq goalies they become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with moncton and the capital district islanders ahl game of the week in early january the ahl started a game of the week the game produced by i believe pyman productions was televised across the canadian maritimes and northeastern us the first few weeks saw two games of the week one in canada and another in the us but since then there has been only one sunday afternoon and night games were covered and shown on sportschannel ny and ne in the us and i believe atlantic sports network in canada but i m not sure about that i am not sure if playoff games will be covered utica gone syracuse added there were heavy rumors that the utica devils will not be around next season there were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern city and that the city of syracuse is trying to lure them what the ahl might look like next year one option another option northern division southern division adirondack red wings adirondack springfield indians springfield providence bruins providence cd islanders cdi portland pirates hershey binghamton southern division rochester hershey bears hamilton binghamton rangers utica rochester americans hamilton canucks atlantic division utica devils portland st john s atlantic division saint john st john s maple leafs moncton moncton hawks halifax halifax citadels fredericton cape breton oilers cape breton fredericton canadiens charlottetown saint john blue flames charlottetown senators move is unofficial as yet ),1
nah let s reserve rec sports idiots for people who post obvious flamebait like yourself if someone posts something as controversial not to mention idiotic as what austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup someone should challenge the statement there is a school of thought that suggests that silence consent whereas this idea may not apply to everything in life it certainly should apply to a forum of public discussion which r s b is if you ve been reading r s b lately you ll find that even elementary school children have had access to our postings alibet in an edited form it s making me think a little more carefully about some of the things i post in conclusion if someone like austin wants to post his drivel in some obscure newsgroup that i do n t read fine he s got the right to rant rave and drool all he wants to in the name of free speech but if he drools in a newsgroup that i read then i will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal to his drooling now of course you do n t have to read any of this and if you want to cut down on flames then don t post flamebait you do n t have to respond to flames either saves cyberspace ),0

well sherri i d agree with you except that most kiddies have more sense than to spew their obscenities in front of a group of adults i try to edit this newsgroup and feed it to one of the local elementary schools they have a group of students that just love baseball and are learning to use computers but i m telling you it s gotten to the point that i do n t even edit the files anymore just read them and throw out the trash and thanks to all you people that think it s wonderful to include a swear word or two in your signature files that s really nice i have to read the whole article and then toss it out because of the sig do n t get me wrong i know all the words you do and i ve even made up some of my own or i would n t be able to edit them out but this just does n t seem to be the place a public forum to spew foul language sorry thanks to all you people that keep in mind there might be some decent young people interested in baseball and computers reading this newsgroup they enjoy your articles .,0
according to the hockey gurus over at espn should the islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record but the devils will be playing the penguins this is because the islanders have won the season series against the devils i think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include qqq season series qqq goals against qqq goals for in this order correct me if i m wrong anyone have anything to add craig,1
i remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work i do n t remember why they said that it did not work anyone remember this jody mcdonnel on wip in phil has been saying that a pitch clock was inevitable how would a pitch clock work on throws to first another pair of suggestions qqq remove the balk rule it is the runners responsibility to stay safe no matter what the pitcher does qqq if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time x qqq to qqq without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base as if walked the no balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage the base walk allows the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base i too find myself surfing when i know that it will be enough time between each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his jewlery .,0

hi guys what happened qqq potvin did n t let six goals by qqq wendel and andreychuk woke up qqq home ice and lots of yelling in the gardens gave the leafs the emotional edge qqq refs calls especially last night tended to favour leafs a couple of comments qqq on gilmour just because the guy is n t one of the three stars does n t mean he was not leading the team someone posted the playoff point total and he s in something like fifth or sixth place plus he walked away with the molson cup given for accumulating points from the three star selection during the regular season qqq on the officiating i ve heard gripes from both ends on this one emotions are very high in this series the rivalry is one of the stronger ones i know of i do have to agree that the officiating last night was pro leaf in general except for whoever missed that slash on gilmour s hand qqq in general i still think detroit has one of the better chances vs pittsburgh though i think the leafs would do better against the blues but not as well if they made it out of the division problem is i like both these teams though i m supporting the leafs on the underdog principle d by the way gilmour tiring out is a lot like bob probert not playing aggressive hockey by the way i m not any sort of expert nor do i claim to be i just like watching a good matchup .,1

i wholeheartedly endorse it i have no problem with the have n t been to many a s games have you seriously i do n t mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts a long time because there is good baseball being played however i do n t like qqq qqq games that take qqq hours because there s a lot of dead time going on in that game i do n t find anything exciting about watching batter or pitcher wander around between pitches or watching the catcher make a slow walk to the mound or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason whitey herzog used to be the master of this the game could be way out of reach and he d still be making switches for platoon advantage i want to see the game not people standing around i do n t really enjoy watching nfl football games in person for example because there s so much dead time you do n t really notice how much dead time there is if you watch it on television because they re busy showing you replays i do n t like that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game the ncaa has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next year they re going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next year and they re going to a qqq second clock there s also a difference in how tolerant i am of long games if i m watching them on the tube and if i m going there in person for me going to an a s game has become a major commitment of time one that i m not willing to make that often the length of their games is costing the a s revenue from me .,0

um the header said career hodapp managed about qqq pa in his nine years in the majors as for his consistently over qqq make that three years in a row preceded by a part time year plus his last year with boston hodapp only qualified for the batting title five times was he injured he retired right around his qqq birthday anyway hodapp put up flashy numbers the year everybody put up flashy numbers that was his only really good year with a bat his other qqq years were marred by a lack of power and an inability to draw walks only qqq of those qqq pa were bases on balls which does not describe a feared hitter on the other hand he was part of the long line of famous cleveland qqq wambsganss riggs stephenson etc .,0
you re right thomas gonzalez sheffield and griffey do n t even begin to compare with ripken boggs and gwynn so no wonder alomar gets so much attention sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was terrible so was his sophomore year national league pitchers are much better pitchers that certainly explains sheffield s qqq hm are you confusing have era s that are qqq lower because they do n t face dh s with much better ?,0

this is true but the main thing the commish i e selig needs to do is to suspend bobby cox you can not allow a team to come out at the ump as the braves did i usually rip umps but in this case the players were dead wrong cox should go for qqq games if i had ever umped a game where that happened i d have ejected every player that came out only cox and gant would have been spared and then cox would have gone in the ensuing argument .,0
ok but have you seen tabaracci play yet in his two starts and his relief effort for beaupre he has looked mighty sharp do n t forget the shutout i think he s let in just four goals over eight periods of play i like hrivnak but we might actually have to give some credit to david poile for a change after this trade hopefully if tabaracci starts against the isles tonight i have n t jinxed him .,1

they re real and they re spectacular the blues shutout the blackhawks in consecutive playoff games if the blues sweep the hawks on sunday i will launch a broom onto the ice in the last seconds of the game not that there s anything wrong with that curtis joseph has been the master of his own domain and the hawks have been shooting the puck like a bunch of chuckers not even superman could play any better in goal joseph must have been eating his cereal it s like a sauna in here said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and the wild crowd at the arena it was very refreshing to see the blues double dip the hawks the hawks goons tried to pick on hull janney and joseph but the blues checking line nipped those hawks real well the fat yoyoma will sing on sunday and the hawks will head to the beach the hawks trip back to chicago will feel like a long journey from milan to minsk enjoy sunday s game with some junior mints and wash them down with a snapple just a little fun .,1
listen guys you can talk about this the whole playoffs i m here in a small town in southern illinois at school i m from canada and i know that cbc and tsn have games on every night all you have to do is go to a bar with a satellite i have watched both games between mon que and toronto and detroit not to mention van vs winn and with cbc they show all goals from every game that evening so i have n t missed a goal all playoffs well have to go boy leafs are on ciao .,1

this is what kills me speaking of die hard that s what i did when i read this died hard laughing toronto to the cup finals first of all has anyone on the planet heard of the team from detroit al morgani or however you spell the idiot s name must be from chicago because on espn he said it s not even close chicago will definatly win the norris division in the playoffs no other team is close everyone is picking chicago i do n t get it he says it s an easy choice god chicago was qqq qqq qqq against the wings and they won the division by a point or two followed closely by toronto who is also a good team as for the leafs beating detroit doubt it but even if they do they are n t going to get by chicago if even more amazingly they get past the hawks they would probably face vancouver and lose as for the habs reaching the finals forget it even i as a devoted wings fan will watch the penguins easily three peat as cup winners lemieux jagr tocchet stevens and barrasso its a done deal sorry detroit wait til next year but hey these were paul s picks and everyone has a right to their own opinnions but the leafs to the finals yeah if they make it there i ll walk to toronto to get some tickets and that s a qqq mile walk ryan -,1
this is a general question for us readers how extensive is the playoff coverage down there in canada it is almost impossible not to watch a series on tv ie the only two series i have not had an opportunity to watch this year are wash nyi and chi stl the latter because i m in the wrong time zone we in canada are basically swamped with coverage and i wonder how many series games are televised nationally or even locally in the us and how much precedence they take over say local news if the games go into double ot email me so as not to waste bandwidth please my news feed is kind of slow anyways .,1
according to the fan here in t o ottawa has won the daigle e sweepstakes they did n t mention why but san jose had more goals than the sen sens so i have a hunch this is why ottawa would pick first .,1
that more or less says it i flicked the penguins game on briefly and saw ulf cross check valeri in the face i am wondering if don cherry is going to go off on this at all in coach s corner and that was the only infraction of this type in the game come on wake up geez he s not the only player who does this sort of thing i think we were kind of lucky the game was not really all that chippy considering the state nj is in about now .,1

you think that s bad one year we had all three new york teams in the playoffs and the cableco operator scny once shared a channel with bet but someone forgot to throw the switch at qqq did n t know what i was talking about while it s nice that the nhl is back on american network tv it faces the same problems as it did with the all star game local preemptions and zero promotion okay i do n t watch that much tv so i m just foaming all right the league should have made sure that it was solid on cable before going to the networks in year one of the new espn contract the saturation coverage of sca all other games shown to completion like the quebec montreal and sabres bruins overtimes is missed around here gld,1

as she said the letter is addressed to bettman the post which though having pretty much the same content is an entirely different entity was addressed to all when she puts the letter in the mail i doubt it will say to all i figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here that s an entirely different purpose than sending the letter to bettman unfortunately the largest computer networks in the world phrase is a definition of the internet not a group as a whole that she claims to represent as for the business of whether or not it is large it is large compared to say the number of folks on r s h who are sending a letter to thank him for changing the names at least to this point and just for my own curiosity i thought i d look up the official definition of large in the dictionary it reads large qqq having more than usual power capacity or scope qqq exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size now i have no idea how many letters bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them qqq people may be up there thereby validating definition qqq i would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large which would give it a large scope why would he be impressed with this unless it were large i am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing and are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear yourself speak i personally do n t know whether or not i agree with the letter i have very mixed emotions about it i like the names as they are and do n t think they make it that difficult to learn the game but there might be a shred of validity to the change .,1

to those who are wondering what is happening in minnesota from what i have seen in the local news tv and newspaper various people in the area are trying to get a new hockey team a columnist for the st paul pioneer press wrote an article giving the inside scoop on the issue there are three local sites competing for a team and three possible candiates to move to the twin cities first the sites target center civic center st paul and yes even the met center the columnist was pretty confident that minnesota will get a team and that the target center will ultimately win out he argued however that the competition from the other two sites will delay the process considerably without the inter site competition the columnist sorry i ca n t remember his name believes that minnesota would have a team by the qqq qqq season also because of the situation with the timberwolves things will be delayed until unless the city of minneapolis takes over the target center however they are unlikely to do so until the met center is destroyed because the city will lose money if there is competition from the met for conventions and short term events even with hockey at target to add to this mess a study qqq to qqq months is going to be conducted on the future viability of the met center which obviously delays the process even further i hope that the study is cancelled which will have the effect of knocking the met center out of the running and perhaps encouraging minneapolis to take over the target center sooner the city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the met which may happen regarding possible candidates the three teams are hartford tampa bay and new jersey i would prefer the devils minnesota ice demons although the lightning may have potential although it has n t been announced yet it looks like qqq neutral site games will be played at the target center next year apparently the devils are interested in playing in as many of those six games as possible and i would n t be surprised to see hartford and tampa show up there either so minnesota may end up getting another team but it may take a few years go sabres !,1

well i could become a fan seriously this news coming since thursday has effectively robbed the islanders and the devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost everywhere that i ve sampled in fact the playoffs almost do n t exist now ranger fans calling in to wfan or to new york one s midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near orgasm over keenan s hiring summarizing keenan is a winner and will give the broadway bums da business in pursuing the next cup chase this will be an interesting combination to watch keenan has been paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach but his advice on any player moves will be listened to closely a lot of big player moves will happen remember that keenan got rid of denis savard the country club days are over if paramount had given smith an earlier sign of support and offered keenan the big money to put up and shut up back in january the rangers might not be heading for golf now one of keenan s first statements was a reaffirmation that mark messier will be the team s captain by then smith might have some bargains on keenan s advice like maybe unloading phil bourque for tie domi gld,1
well it s not that bad but i am still pretty pissed of at the local abc coverage they cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing david brinkley at qqq instead of an earlier time slot i do n t even understand their problem if they did nt think enough people would not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game and if they showed the remaining qqq hours of the game would it hurt to play david brinkley at its regular time they do nt have any decent programming before noon anyway i called the sports dept and blasted them on their machine i called gain and someone picked it up when i asked him why they premepted the first half hour of the stanley cup playoffs he seemed a bit confused when i explained a bit more in detail he then said that s upto to our programming dept call back on monday weel i understand that the sports dept is not responsible for this preemption but i ca n t understand how someone in the sports dept ca n t even recognise the name of playoffs shown on the very same station he works for anyway i am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again i urge all atlanta hockey fans to call wsb qqq and ask them not to do the same thing for the next qqq weeks .,1

qqq peter ahola season qqq acquired qqq qqq trade with pittsburgh for future considerations grade i b it is way too early to tell about ahola who was acquired probably because the penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft ahola had only played qqq games this season i think it s actually less the san jose mercury news may be in err here qqq of them with the sharks in the games he has played he appeared quite solid defensively although he has n t been spectacular and his offense is n t anything to write home about qqq points it s even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be peter ahola qqq doug wilson season qqq acquired qqq qqq trade with chicago for rw kerry toporowski and qqq round pick in qqq entry draft grade i b i have often been accused of overly down on wilson i may have had too high expectations for him but his legs knees et al are giving out nevertheless when he was playing he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities even if he has lost a step on defense which unfortunately he demonstrated this year as well as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards and his offensive output was only good enough for qqq place on the team qqq points in qqq games but next year which may be wilson s last if he can stay healthy he can still be a contributor qqq dean kolstad season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i c d it s probably somewhat unfair for me to judge kolstad on just a handful of games forgetting exact number but no more than qqq but at age qqq he s quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the nhl in those games he did not impress anyone after generating qqq shots in the first period of the first game he played he scored just qqq points in his tenure up here with the sharks and was even less impressive defensively as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways he needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team qqq pat macleod season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i macleod was on the roster a lot longer than kolstad but it appears to my memory that he played less than kolstad because the sharks were reluctant to use him but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors figuring that he would n t clear waivers in fact he has played the past qqq qqq weeks with kansas city but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment a rehab assignment that will include him playing in the turner cup playoffs since he has played so little i ca n t even give a tentative grade on him but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills qqq tom pederson season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i b called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries pederson impressed many sharks fan here on net including yours truly he demonstrated very good offensive skills scoring qqq points in qqq games however his size qqq qqq qqq lbs is of concern and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically on both sides of the ice although he had appeared fearless in his approach but to be successful he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league qqq claudio scremin season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i d d he played all of qqq games in the league this year but was thoroughly umimpressive just as he was at the end of last season again it may be a small sample but just as in the case of kolstad scremin at age qqq is quickly running out of time he was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the sharks the only notable thing that will go down in scremin s entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now capitals goaltender don beaupre .,1
went to the dodgers game tonight it was cap night astacio pitched ok but had control trouble all night in the first he walked a batter balked him to second then a single scored the run with the batter taking second on the throw home another single made the score qqq qqq cards lasorda tried a new line up featuring butler reed and piazza batting third darryl and eric were benched in favor of snyder and webster piazza homered in the first to make the score qqq qqq cards the dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by offerman by the fourth inning astacio had already made about qqq pitches but the score was still qqq qqq the dodger defense made several impressive plays piazza looked great behind the plate gunning down a runner trying to steal second throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base etc karros also made a spectacular play keeping a ball from going into the outfield the runner on first was so sure that ball was going through he just kept running past second karros got up and threw to third and easily got the runner at third my heart sank in the qqq when gross got up to warm up in the bullpen astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter and when gross entered the game with the score still qqq qqq dodger fans just knew it was over gross was relieving because he stunk on tuesday pitching just qqq qqq innings forcing lasorda to use much of his bullpen the qqq inning game had the same effect the next night so only gross was fresh given his light work out tuesday gross lived up to his name he walked the first batter gave up a hit to the second and walked the bases loaded after a grounder resulted in a force at home zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it qqq qqq cards gross paid little attention to the runners and the next thing you knew the cards had stolen a fourth run the runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down but the qqq run had scored long before that meanwhile the dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning lee smith pitched the ninth he had little trouble getting karros and wallach does anyone have trouble with wallach these days cory snyder collected his first hit as a dodger a single but that was all the offense the dodgers could mount smith got his third straight save against the dodgers and all i got was my free dodger cap and a good look at piazza if piazza keeps this up all year he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors though its really early karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year the final score cardinals qqq runs on qqq hits dodgers qqq runs on qqq hits .,0
there is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just a little over a decade ago and noone showed up for the early rounds in the playoffs whereas soon after they went to the divisional set up arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds the empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the bruins play the sabre umpteen times than see the bruins play the captials in the first round maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case the experiment is worthwhile with the uneven distribution of the expansion teams but i prefer the divisional playoff .,1

he s been playing horrible defense baylor said after wednesday s game that he wanted to shake up the lineup a little because bichette has been having a rough time defensively and jerald clark has not been hitting he was true to his word i went to thursday s game and gerald young was in right and daryl boston who has a very hot bat was in left baylor was careful to say though that he did n t necessarily mean for these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two a shot while clark and bichette were not playing well in defense of bichette it looks like right field in mile high stadium is a bitch to play some of the visiting outfielders have been having some problems too although bobby bonilla made a great catch crashing into the wall to rob daryl boston of an extra base hit in thursday s game ),0

yes that s him was i not specific enough just because someone consistently pulls the ball does not mean that they have a quick bat dawson s release is slow and he is qqq after all he may swing early and rotate his hips so that he hits the ball to the left side all the time but he swings slowly as for me disagreeing with peter gammons whoa that s never happened before next thing you know i ll probably believe dave campbell is the biggest imbecile even to come near a mic and that ray knight has the iq of drained crankcase oil .,0

implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against winnipeg with selanne on the ice can be blamed on him roger he is a forward winnipeg has a lousy defensive record anyway let s put it another way john cullen s is terrible what s your excuse for him that his powerplay points do n t count neither do selanne s knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that feeding selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to winning you re worried about teemu when you have glenn anderson on your team what he does best is score so i refer you to my comment above .,1

yes a point well taken however even in areas that finally got some games there s something nagging in the back of your skull when the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its sports news there s an awesome overtime going on in quebec city and we ll try to get you an update through the show when you know that it s on a satellite s feedhorn somewhere up there from today s times abc got great ratings in chicago and st louis a qqq and the kings flames got a qqq on the west coast but only a qqq in metro new york i e the devils squandered their newfound support from a year ago when they played the rangers in comparison seniors golf did better i fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great i ca n t tell if abc did any advance marketing or not cos i do n t watch much tv the nhl should have made sure that it was solid on cable before going on the air even espn could ve sold second rights to third party systems i e non sportschannel since they are not making any extra money by sitting on the games hockey fans will not necessarily be watching pre season beach volleyball if playoffs games are n t being shown somewhere gld,1

not necessarily it could mean that or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road see frank thomas home road splits in qqq for an example i would guess that some of alomar s split is due to the skydome but most of it is probably due just to coincidence there s no way to be sure of course but the only hitters the skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters and alomar is not a home run hitter only because of t p s bogus fielding stats which rate alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league on a career basis i think t p s fielding stats may mean something but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is but he sure is n t the worst in baseball offensively t p rate alomar much higher last year regarding the a vs b argument i ll just say they re both very good players with different strengths and a bright future .,0

you mention could cut it as stars in the nhl even rexi in his prime was more of a good regular in new york edmonton than a superstar in his own right although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf i think that the ny management made a mistake and remember how edmonton called reksa in the middle of the season to win the cup why did they call him yeah we ve had a tendency to beat ourselves in the past i almost knifed my brother in anger when sweden scored two in the final minute of the wc semifinals back in qqq or what about the three goals antero kivela let in with five minutes to go against the russkies in lake qqq ugh o k that was bad luck if penguins have the same kind of luck this year in the playoffs they ll never win the cup they are still the best team .,1

no argument at all with murphy he scared the hell out of me when he came in last year on the other hand the club though enough of boever to put him into an awful lot of games he may have led the league in appearances he did at least at some point he seemed to be a very viable setup guy but i guess that s not considered that crucial by the club i can just remember two years ago so well though i m not that concerned those guys have been relatively consistent over the years and they have no good reasons to decline no injuries not old i expect them to come through just fine it s those guys that have not been consistently good that are the worrisome part even if they are coming through right now this sounds like their old road unis pretty dull buttons or pullovers i ll check through my uniform book to see if they ve always had some orange well we ll see i ve got a astros pullover shirt with the astros stripes across the shoulders and i have trouble making myself wear it in public i can see why they might want that to change gee if they eliminate the orange will they reupholster the seats in the astros stripes section what used to be the gold and yellow levels i do n t know those numbers they use now i saw a pinstripe version of an astros cap and i actually thought it looked good !,0
actually they re pretty worthless if you want to evaluate players with stats rbis and runs scored should be banned all they do is confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself you uh so you ve just explained why we use obp and slg to evaluate players precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored that s where obp slg runs created linear weights etc come in these simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player s offensive contribution to the team s runs scored thank you for making our case have a nice day .,0
after watching the pengiuns all year and as many other teams as possible i ve really noticed an increase in tom barasso s cheap shots this year and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders i ve also noticed that he usually gets away with it just as examples last night i noticed him elbowing scott stevens in the head which basically started the whole shoving match that got stevens scott and tocchet qqq minute minors he also kicked john mclean of course he was n t called for that is n t kicking an automatic match penalty and qqq game suspension i think glenn anderson got one a few years ago for kicking gaetan duchesne in the chest there s no doubt in my mind that barasso is the dirtiest golatender since hextall he s also very good how about that tocchet head butt is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a non kicking match penalty i ca n t remember anymore .,1

the answer is they re stupid seriously i think you re right on the money i ve never understood the preoccupation with making sure a rotation has left handed starters the only time it makes sense to me is when you have an unbalanced schedule and your main rival s is loaded with lefthanded hitters other than that i think you re completely right .,0
ugliest stance of all time has to go to oscar gamble the man would practically kneel in front of home plate in order to have a small strike zone he s just lucky that strike zone size is n t determined by how big your afro is ),0
the defenition of the underdog is a team that has no talent and comes out of nowhere to contend the qqq mets and qqq orioles are prime examples not the cubs i root for the cubs because i feel sorry for them but basically they are dogs the pirates today are a great example of an underdog if the rockies and marlins compete they will be underdogs the north stars trip to the stanley cup finals was a good example of an underdog s journey the cubs have a good team this year and play in a weak division they are much less than america s team .,0
in detroit the octopus is a symbol from the old days of the league in the era of the original qqq four teams made the playoffs to win the cup a team had to win two seven game series in other words it took qqq playoff wins to win the cup the octopus qqq legs has become a common detroit symbol every year around playoff time people start sneaking octopus octopi into the joe louis arena and throwing them onto the ice .,1

i watched the final inning of bosio s no hitter with several people at work after vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove he would n t have had time to throw riles out yet the throw beat riles by about two steps i wonder how many others who watched the final out think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand does anybody think vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded and if he failed to field it cleanly would it or should it have been an error or a hit judging from bosio s grimace when the ball bounced past him he must have thought it would go through for a hit whether vizquel was right or wrong he certainly made one hell of a play phil brown aka qqq |,0

did they move probert back to defense why did i see him parking his ass in front of potvin all night somebody is going to have to discipline probert if the leafs want to win the series perhaps a fresh clark should hit the ice at the end of a long probert shift and straigten him out for a while -,1

alright that s enough i ve suffered with all kinds of insults as typical for the net but give me a break galarraga is currently batting over qqq and you guys are complaining that he is n t drawing enough walks what would he have to do to please you guys bat qqq you can hardly claim that he is hurting his team if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen then i would agree with you that he is n t taking enough pitches my comment that he is n t paid to walk does n t mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs it s more along the lines of he s batting qqq and leading the league in rbi s so what bloody difference does it make if he is n t drawing a lot of walks sheesh .,0
did anyone happen to see peter gammons on espn last night he addressed this exact issue and dismissed it rather quickly according to gammons advanced scouts are reporting that morris fastball and slider still have the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability to keep the ball hidden during his release guzman and stottlemyre have gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a little work with the pitching coach gammons looks to see morris back in top form within the month i on the other hand still have my doubts morris era last year was rather high for a pitcher who won qqq games his showing in the series was not surprising although i m not convinced that he s washed up i have my doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the twins in qqq .,0

there was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams no matter ow bad they are that s bullshit anyone who would follow the pens or the pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are losers it s ok to follow and be concerned about your home team but to give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck should not be required of a true fan a true fan would follow the team in troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team when i visit pittsburgh i ll refuse to go to a pirates game since i think the management has given pittsburgh a team which could have been much better even if they could n t sign barry bonds lert s say the pens start doing to their own team what the oilers have done this year and what the whalers have done in recent years i would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the team i ll still follow it and bitch about it but i wo n t waste my money on mediocre teams .,1
i did not write that in fact those statements were a rebuttal to an earlier posting that i made and this was culled from my strong rebuttal to those statements please slander shame after the game it s no big deal after the employees leave the workplace it does n t matter what they say about the boss or the company puhlease first it s ross porter second i am really tired of seeing the kind of response that indicates that all i do is parrot what some media person says or writes i have a brain if i choose to characterize something in a certain fashion it s because that is what i believe to be accurate it is not just because some unnamed mediot made the characterization i did not brand darryl s response as petulant because i never heard any response from darryl i did call him a name i referred to him as a primadonna someone else concluded that i did that because i hate him i do n t hate him i think he s a primadonna if you disagree fine but stop putting words in my mouth the beastmaster,0
philadelphia at chicago teams tied for qqq after sunday dick redding battled chet brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series one friday one saturday and a good old sunday doubleheader what could be better declared ernie banks perhaps the fact that the cubs are challenging it s pitching it s always been pitching that we ve lacked announced ryne sandberg if we can get by brewer then beat carlton alexander or bunning preferrably qqq of the last three we ll know we might be able to win lord i hope we pull it off the phils scored once in the top of the first richie ashburn singled pete rose followed with a hit sending ashburn around second kiki cuyler cut the ball off in left center and threw a bullet in to ernie banks who threw to ron santo to get ashburn at third rose went to second on the play christobel torrienti lifted a long fly to center moving pete rose to third schmidt was walked the cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them both torrienti and schmidt will likely draw qqq qqq walks this year chuck klein is starting to hit very well and he lashed a double into a gap in right center cool papa bell s speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent schmidt from scoring nellie fox was walked and bob boone grounded out to second ending the threat teams are starting to realize that you do n t have to pitch to schmidt or torrienti and that is lowering their run total it puts a lot of pressure on klein and dick allen who platoons with chuck klein and occasionally spells rose at first and it s a credit to the phillies that they ve been able to sustain their pace the picthers have slumped at times so came the analysis from frank chance the cubs got that run back when bell bunted for a hit thomas grounder moved him to second and after sandberg made out billy williams singled home a run in the sixth ron santo launched a two run homer to make it qqq qqq dick redding got in trouble in the eighth as schmidt singled and klein singled him to third ed reulbach entered to face fox but dick allen popped out of the dugout to hit allen doubled to right but luckily for the cubs williams had moved to left and andre dawson had been inserted for defense he fired a bullet to home plate to keep klein at third lance parrish hitting for boone was walked and bruce sutter entered larry bowa grounded into a qqq qqq qqq double play but ed delahanty walked as a pinch hitter desiring a strikeout since ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick trillo pinch running at third chance brought in lee smith who induced a pop up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder ending the inning the cubs took the win qqq qqq moving a game behind the phillies steve carlton was called upon to battle qqq brown saturday to get another righthander in the lineup ron santo moved to first and bill madlock played third unfortunately brown allowed six doubles and the cub bullpen was worn down even more as the cubs tried to maintain a lead against lefty madlock batting sixth had knocked two doubles of his own driving home four runs gabby hartnett hit two home runs and cuyler added another and the score was qqq qqq cubs after six innings the phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth as the cubs grabbed qqq more runs to ice an qqq qqq triumph sunday s twin bill saw cool papa bell gather seven straight hits at one point including a rare outside the park home run in the second game off robin roberts grover alexander of the phils took the first contest qqq qqq but the cubs captured the second one qqq qqq with waddell gaining the win bruce sutter tossed two innings for the save though he allowed one run in the eighth the cardinals stood half a game behind these co leaders and would conclude their series with the expos on monday montreal at st louis august qqq qqq qqq tie for qqq dennis martinez is on a roll and he continued it versus john tudor friday the expos have a wide variety of hitters and while they are n t among the all time greats they are getting the job done after winning their first first two games they suddenly found themselves only qqq qqq games out of first in this wacky season martinez triumphed qqq qqq on friday and williams outdueled dizzy dean qqq qqq saturday however the cardinals refused to give up winning qqq qqq on sunday the cards captured monday s game too as steve carlton outdueled steve rogers qqq qqq we re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed remarked lou brock i do n t see why we ca n t win this division the phillies and cubs may have some reasons for them two thirds of the way through the season there is a qqq tie for first new york at pittsburgh august qqq qqq qqq straight qqq qqq wins for bucs now qqq back but in qqq when your team is in a slump like we are the worst thing is to play in a pitcher s park like this spoke gil hodges before the series keith hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year and it must be giving them an extra qqq qqq wins the pirates have made only qqq errors all season qqq ahead of the second place dodgers error totals tend to be around qqq for the best defensive all time teams rube foster defeated sid fernandez qqq qqq friday and candelaria outshone seaver qqq qqq saturday in a game featuring some outstanding defense when nolan ryan and two relivers qqq the mets in another qqq qqq win sunday the pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the qqq mark they had been unable to several times in the past month bert blyleven met dwight gooden in the afternoon game both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs a solo shot by rusty staub of the mets and a two run blast by ralph kiner for the pirates the mets darryl strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off jesse orosco working his second inning after mookie wilson pinch ran for gary carter at second with one out and a runner on first lee mazilli was sent in to pinch hit the pirates countered with kent tekulve placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting barry bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter tekulve induced a groundout forcing strawberry at second he slid hard into honus wagner preventing the pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon tekulve allowed a hit but clemente threw mazilli out at third from near the right field line ending the inning tug mcgraw relieved randy myers who entered to pitch the eighth and got one out before bonds launched a rocket to deep center running through the stop sign at third to score an inside the park homer to win the pirates had scored an improbable qqq straight qqq qqq wins and had moved to within qqq games of first place with seven weeks to go san francisco at boswaukta august qqq qqq another sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule as the giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just would n t tire in fact reported manager john mcgraw once this rough part of the schedule is over maybe as early as this coming week we may shift to a qqq rotation again for a little while juan marichal continued his hot pitching friday beating lew burdette and the braves qqq qqq willie mays had all four r b i s on qqq hits rick reuschel faced joe niekro saturday in a slugfest the braves park had been a homer haven but this took the cake as the giants won a seesaw affair qqq qqq willie mays had three homers willie mccovey eddie matthews and don baylor had two and hank aaron ernie lombardi biz mackey and mel ott had one each the braves had collected qqq home runs going into sunday s doubleheader putting them on a pace for qqq which would be qqq short of the national league record they were still a tad behind the qqq yankees pace they had allowed over qqq though vida blue actually got the win after retiring qqq batters in the fifth he allowed only a run in the sixth but faltered in the seventh joe mcginnity earned the save in the doubleheader the braves hoyt wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game but hank aaron homered off bill foster in the eighth as the braves won qqq qqq the giants took the second game however by a qqq qqq score the homer by aaron was a magical qqq by the braves however they fell to three game below qqq making a comeback extremely unlikely san diego at cincinnati aug qqq qqq randy jones faced ewell blackwell in the first of this qqq series and the padres felt rather good with don mattingly straining his back in the last cleveland game the trade looked even better mcgriff s batting average was even rising of course the bench was very poor and joe gordon was only adequate in the outfield but these were minor problems since the pitching was holding up jones pitched a good game friday and won qqq qqq mcgriff launched two home runs mel harder earned a win with the help of mark davis and ray narleski saturday qqq qqq was the final score tom candiotti battled satchel paige to a qqq qqq tie through eight innings before departing the game was scoreless for qqq more innings until the thirteenth paige had departed after qqq and john franco hurled a scoreless inning tom browning was working his second scoreless inning when dave winfield doubled with one out and joe gordon was pitched around thurm munson doubled both runners home and the padres gamed a qqq qqq win the three game sweep had pulled the giants into a tie with the reds though the reds denied it the highly emotional series with the dodgers may have taken too much out of them brookangeles at houston august qqq qqq another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the astrodome the astros sent joe niekro to the hill in the first game opposite don drysdale normally drysdale remarked i would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them i ca n t afford to with this team though we have to get our own runners going we ca n t davis will get decked once the fact that glenn davis leads the team in homers with six is primarily why he would be decked but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season the hitting on this team is a little better but the power is all doubles and triples still carl furillo is the main reason no astro home runs were hit over the weekend as he threw two runners out trying for inside the park homers for those unaware of the nastness of the astros park they have a qqq high gray wall all around the outfield balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs the foul poles are qqq feet from home plate but the alleys are qqq feet away with center field at qqq feet it s as if some three year old threw a tantrum and told his playmates if i ca n t hit home runs nobody will hit home runs remarked roy campanella the dodgers stole five bases friday but the astros decided to revitalize the baltimore chopping that had failed qqq weeks before for tonight anyway davis jim wynn and jose cruz did not have to mess with their swings according to the manager after poles and willie wells reached base via the baltimore chop drysdale decked jose cruz with a pitch he responded with a two run double but wynn playing first for davis popped up and the astros did n t score any more in that inning they did score qqq in the fourth to erase a qqq qqq deficit and the astros wound up winning qqq qqq they threatened to do even better the next game as tommy john would be their opponent walt alston met privately with the starters at qqq a m before the game i think i know how we can beat the baltimore chop he explained how can we do that pee wee reese wondered they re going to be beating the ball down so we ve got to be ready to throw on the run steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt but i want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws we ll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time the plan almost worked mike scott allowed only two runs through eight innings but the astros got three two of them scored when bill doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third qqq qqq astros was the final with dave smith earning another save the dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill sunday as nolan ryan walked five three of whom scored in a qqq qqq dodger win fernando valenzuela lost the second game qqq qqq to don sutton however as the dodgers thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough we re mostly a power team remarked ron cey jackie and when he plays maury wills are our only real speed demons though a couple other plays can do it now and then we re sunk in a place like the astrodome i guess that s why they re so successful there indeed it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome the stros swiped qqq bases in qqq attempts giving them qqq on

the runner can leave his base at any time if the ball is caught he s got to tag up if it is n t caught he _ does n t _ have to tag up at all so if he s feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up if it is n t caught he s probably scored a run if it is he s probably headed for aaa the only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out thereby removing the force on the runners on base all other rules apply as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up .,0

that would be clint malarchuck it was speculated at the time that the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end of the rink at the time he was playing in the same end as the ambulence is parked he never would have survived ditto if he were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on standby if you ve seen video tape of the incident it is amazing how much blood there was it was literally spurting out all over the ice as clint grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror amazingly enough he made a full recovery and played again in the nhl he was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway and did n t play for too long afterward some people speculated that he just could n t get himself back together after the incident and i think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward he did eventually get back to form and played another year or so after that and then i believe he retired anyone else carol boudreau qqq a k a the x terminator boudreau athena mit edu go flames rock the kings !,1

i finally got it back with great thanks to mark spiegel for saving and sending it qqq rob zettler season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade c c zettler gave the sharks every bit he s got this year unfortunately this still was n t enough to make him any more than a marginal nhler if that he works hard for sure but is no better than average on defense and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times while being basically an offensive zero qqq goal and qqq assists in qqq games he would be hardpressed to make the team next year qqq david williams season qqq acquired qqq qqq free agent from new jersey grade c c imo williams was the most valuable defenseman for the sharks in qqq qqq playing a combination of good offense qqq goals and qqq assists in qqq games and good defense but he playing the first part of this season in kansas city was good neither offensively nor defensively this year it then appears that qqq qqq was a fluke although he improved towards the end of the season he was prone to being out of position defensively and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team s leading scorer among defensemen last year he would also be hardpressed to make the team next year qqq jayson more season qqq acquired qqq qqq from montreal in expansion draft grade b after being touted as the team s top defensive prospects in training camp before qqq qqq more had a rather disappointing qqq qqq as he was not particularly good defensively and had just qqq points in qqq games he then proceeded to improve his game massively this season becoming the team s most reliable defenseman whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional but only occasional offensive flash offensively he was even more disappointing than last year qqq points in qqq games but his defense improved tremendously he is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman qqq neil wilkinson season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b wilkinson was probably the team s top defensive defenseman in qqq qqq however partially because of injuries he was not the same this year as he missed qqq games total due to nagging knee and back injuries and seemed to be slowed even when playing he then had often to be saved by his defensive partners that is if they are there at all but he also had some solid games and if he can be complete healthy he can still be a force qqq sandis ozolinsh season qqq acquired qqq qqq qqq round pick in entry draft grade i a at the time of his injury december qqq against the philadelphia flyers ozolinsh was well on track to be imo the team s mvp a serious knee injury in that game though forced him to miss the rest of the season qqq games but he still finished as the team s top scorer among defensemen qqq points which of course tells more about the lack of offense the sharks had from their defensemen but it also tells of ozolinsh s abilities at the time he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still susceptible to so called rookie mistakes but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team rookie or veteran if he can come back from his injuries he is ready to be a star qqq doug zmolek season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b zmolek had basically a solid and durable year being one of the only two sharks to play in all qqq games of the season he was solid on defense but after being billed as an offensive defenseman he did n t show it qqq points he was also prone to penalties and his qqq penalty minutes was second on the team however that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents and he was at his best when playing physically but to become a fixture in this league he needs to improve both offensively and defensively and cut down on the number of power plays he gives to opponents .,1
i totally agree with each point you made jose viscaino looked like a single a hitter up there who swings on qqq qqq count with maddux pitching and your teams down by a run and you have n t touched the ball all day i also think too much is made of that lefty righty thing watching the cubs games i get the feeling steve stone knows a lot more about what the cubs should be doing than lefebre does harry said it best when he stated after another terrible vizcaino at bat we ca n t wait til sandberg returns !,0
i do n t personally but clay just posted it yes we do unfortunately it shows that lopez was n t as good an example as nieves would have been since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous years which i did n t have access to the point remains though knowing a guy s minor league history is as good as knowing his major league history if you know how to read it the mle is not a projection it s an equivalence it s a this is how well he hit last year in major league terms rating so in essence he has already reached it i would guess bob clay that essentially half of all players surpass their previous mles in their rookie seasons maybe more than half since all of these players are young and improving did they offerman may have been the difference between qqq or qqq place and last place but no more sure they did n t have anyone better i suppose they might have gutted the farm system to acquire jay bell or spike owen or somebody if they were really in contention if you d read what i wrote you d be less amazed nowhere do i claim to put any credence in spring training quite the contrary i said that lopez had n t done anything that even the bozos who do put credence in spring training could interpret as failure just because i think spring training numbers are meaningless does n t mean that bobby cox does it s just a case of ruling out one possible explanation for sending lopez down keith mitchell did very very well at aa aaa and the majors over a season then did very very poorly for a year in aaa .,0

maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom these allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times losing money bankruptcies at an alarming rate and there s going to be an increased degradation of the product they produce could you imagine ibm with all their problems promoting themselves the way major league baseball does their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths not that they are too far from it now what would happen at gm where would gm be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an inferior product because of alleged labor problems i think it shows a lack of confidence for the people who run the game forget it word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about a done deal it has to be decided soon since negotiations with the networks also have to begin soon .,0

qqq blues shutout hawks again lead series qqq qqq it was a great atmosphere last night at the st louis arena as joseph and the blues shutout the hawks for the second consecutive game people were cheering the blues long before face off time and they kept going for the entire game my friends and i went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players here s a game summary from the st louis post disptach enjoy by dave luecking of the post dispatch staff at qqq p m friday night the arena crowd of qqq paid homage to blues goalie curtis joseph the fans began bowing their arms extended taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read only god saves more than joseph it was a fitting tribute to joseph who has brought the blues to the verge of a surprising sweep joseph recorded his second successive shutout friday blanking the blackhawks qqq qqq in game qqq of the norris division semifinals and giving the blues a qqq qqq lead in the best of seven series the blackhawks have n t scored against joseph since the qqq mark of the second period of game qqq joseph has shut out the blackhawks for qqq minutes qqq seconds a blues record jacques plante held the previous record of qqq set in the first round of the qqq playoffs against the philadelphia flyers one of only two series the blues have sweeped in their history the blues can wrap up their first sweep since qqq with a victory in game qqq a nationally televised game that begins at noon sunday the blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history both in qqq when they swept philadelphia and los angeles en route to the stanley cup finals the shutout friday was easier than on wednesday in game qqq when joseph had to make qqq saves this time the blues held the shots down to qqq and the blackhawks could n t touch joseph well they touched joseph numerous times shoving him and pushing him at every opportunity to try to get him off his game but joseph and the blues were unfazed dishing out their own punishment along the way the blues grinders bob bassen rich sutter kevin miller and dave lowry wore down the blackhawks taking the visitors from chicago off their game the grinders set the stage for the glamour boys the gifted playmakers and scorers who made the most of their opportunities craig janney brett hull and nelson emerson scored getting one goal in each period hull assisted on janney s first period power play goal after two unwise chicago penalties checker miller set up hull s goal in the second period and rookie denny felsner assisted for emerson who scored at qqq of the final period blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling sweep sweep sweep they also taunted chicago goalie ed belfour bell four bell four they also chanted na na na na hey hey good bye such talk is a tad premature there s still one game left but the blues are on a roll they have the blackhawks on their heels the blues set the tone early on friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play rich sutter leveled bryan marchment and brendan shanahan dumped steve smith at center ice chicago tried to retaliate but troy murray s decision to run into joseph backfired referee dan marouelli gave him a roughing penalty the blues did n t get a shot on goal on the power play and they survived a scare after chicago killed the penalty when rick zombo gave the puck away to steve larmer joseph stopped larmer s shot and everything else chicago threw at him in the first period the hawks ignored the scouting report on joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low where joseph s butterfly style is deadly rookie bret hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period two for hooking and one for holding but chicago got only two shots on goal as many as miller the blues penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against belfour marouelli began calling penalties on the blackhawks to even things up he caught brent sutter hooking shanahan four seconds after hedican s third penalty he called marchment for elbowing janney along the boards at qqq and gave the blues a two man advantage qqq later when christian ruuttu slashed shanahan the blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play and hull got it where he likes it in the high slot hull s shot hit belfour s right shoulder and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line belfour dived back to cover but the puck squirted loose to janney who poked it into the net at qqq for his first goal of the playoffs the blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended and the blackhawks lost their composure joe murphy tripped ron wilson with two seconds remaining in the period and after time had expired smith upset the blues by shooting the puck into the blues bench chris chelios made a move toward joseph as the teams left the ice and marouelli slapped him with a qqq misconduct chicago survived the blues power play but the loss of chelios hurt he did n t return until the midway point of the period and within three minutes of his return hull had increased the blues lead to qqq qqq deflecting in miller s crisp pass try as they might the blackhawks could n t get to joseph who stopped everything they could throw at him he stopped qqq shots in the second period and qqq more in the third chicago also hit the goalpost twice emerson s goal put the game away he went hard to the net and redirected felsner s pass .,1
i do n t think that it is obvious that lots of people are willing to pay the price i m sure someone out there in net land has some facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity sold but even if the trends are relatively flat you have to consider what is happening on a team by team basis when the tv money dries up franchises will be seeking to supplant the lost revenues from alternative sources one of the best sources may be ticket sales example qqq the dodgers the dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales and probably believe that they have the ability to raise prices without hindering revenues i certainly think that is true example qqq the padres they will be lucky to average qqq fans a game this year if they raise prices less if they want to increase their overall revenue base the best thing they can do is put a winning team on the field but given that wo n t happen it wo n t they can probably make more money by lowering ticket prices and running frequent promotions will they do that i have no idea but they wo n t increase prices because it wo n t work for them the only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place each team s market is somewhat different and each owner is going to be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those market forces as a buiness manager i would never want to lower my prices but sometimes that strategy is necessary and sometimes it works you have to consider everything if you want continued success the beastmaster,0

i ve seen it as colmn also blame the associated press after the official scorer balances the official score card they copy it and give it to several diffent people one of those is a person from ap whose job it is to type it up using a template on a laptop and transmit it to the ap offices in new york rockefeller center via the telephone the box scores are not checked and just rebroadcasted over ap s news delivery services if there are corrections those are issued later it is the person sitting in front of a laptop at shea or whereever whose fault that is note the ap puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in most newspapers being the first one last week they were in denver maybe the ap person in denver did this remember they just started with mlb out there check tomorrow s paper qqq and see if the person who is doing it from shea does the same thing .,0
as the subject suggests the flames were not impressive this afternoon dropping a qqq qqq decision to the la kings most of the flames neglected to show up especially in their own zone as the kings hit at least five posts the flames best line was probably skrudland paslawski berube which tells how bad the flames were gary suter scored a great goal in fact all three flame goals were scored by d men yawney and dahlquist getting the others but also made some bonehead plays for the kings pat conacher was especially impressive the games was very chippy as dan mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it there were high sticks cross checks punches hits from behind fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out warren rychel from behind flames dominated the game physically but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses i do n t think vernon can be blamed for any of the goals calgary went with qqq d men as roger johansson played lw he looked lost imho i hope king inserts chris lindbergh paul kruse or sergei makarov for wednesday s game gretzky left the game in the qqq period with a charley horse no idea how serious he did n t return i still think the flames should win this series but they better buckle down .,1

here we are with the sabres up qqq qqq to the bruins and the sabres farm team the rochester amerks on their way to the calder cup urp and what kind of hockey coverage are we getting the same penguins devils every other day crap that everyone else gets what s worse the sportschannel coverage of the islanders appears to be blocked out since we got cba basketball last night if you can believe it i assume the sabres are demanding the sc blackout not espn since we are unbelievably usually considered part of the islanders territory msg coverage of the rangers is blacked out here this despite being a solid seven hours plus from long island does anyone know what grc is doing besides putting their satellite dish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels qqq qqq and qqq did empire demand a fortune for the games what about the games on qqq or whatever number it is there in buffalo has anyone phoned to complain besides me george,1
i think that grant fuhr deserves more credit than that while it s true that the entire sabres team played very well i still believe that if it was n t for grant fuhr the series would now be tied qqq qqq he virtually stole games qqq and qqq for the sabres in both of these games fuhr stood on his head to give the sabres the chance to win especially in game qqq fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied qqq qqq even in game qqq when the sabres won qqq qqq the score seemed to indicate that the sabres dominated however if it had n t been for fuhr the sabres would n t have been up qqq qqq i think it was through the qqq period and the bruins would n t have had to open up the game thereby allowing mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game there is no doubt in my mind that fuhr was the critical factor in the victory in my opinion neely oates and juneau played as well as lafontaine mogilny and hawerchuk the sabres did get extraordinary efforts from hannan sweeney wood and khmylev compared to that of the bruins checkers however the bruins defense imo played better than the sabres defense the sabres have ken sutton playing a regular shift afterall the difference in the series was fuhr who outplayed andy moog gary,1

"by dave luecking of the post dispatch staff at qqq thursday night the scoreboard watchers at the arena began to cheer their cheer quickly turned into a roar and finally the sellout crowd of qqq rose as one to rock the old barn at qqq oakland avenue in a salute to the playoff bound blues the scoreboard had just flashed the news from detroit red wings qqq stars qqq with the north stars loss the blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the norris division good thing because the blues quit playing they held a qqq qqq lead over tampa bay when the detroit minnesota final appeared with qqq minutes qqq remaining in the second period they promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a qqq qqq victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer tampa s bob beers tipped in a pass from shawn chambers but officiating supervisor john d amico and video goal judge rich schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired i m glad i did n t see it go in at the end blues coach bob berry said if the goal had counted he d have been more upset than he was by the blues disappearance in the final qqq minutes holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered berry s anger it was n t pretty at the end he said we played qqq qqq great minutes as good as we played all year it slipped away at the end it should n t have but it did still the blues won prompting another ovation from the crowd at game s end despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season the blues still made the playoffs they ll meet the chicago blackhawks in a best of seven norris division semifinal beginning at noon sunday at chicago stadium the blues finished the regular season with a record of qqq qqq qqq for qqq points their fourth consecutive qqq season minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place with a record of qqq qqq qqq for qqq points tampa bay which played spoiler last week by tying the blues qqq qqq at tampa ended its first season with a record of qqq qqq qqq for qqq points the poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous blues locker room instead the mood was one of relief and some disappointment it s a shame we let down said kevin miller one of three blues to score two goals brendan shanahan and bob bassen were the others there was no need for a letdown if we d have kept working it would have ended qqq qqq and everyone would be happy instead a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs we won and that s all that matters said brett hull scoreless and qqq for the night once we got up qqq qqq it was really tough to play some players did n t have a problem just because the score was announced our line did n t quit said rich sutter who played with bassen and miller we still had a game to play you ca n t allow five goals like we did that s not right it was disappointing to see what was going on bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the blues effort somehow he missed the announcement of minnesota s loss i did n t know it was final he said i was kind of looking around on the bench i did n t realize it was a final for some reason we re in the playoffs and that s great but it s a little disappointing to play like we did at the end the letdown was precisely the reason that berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the minnesota detroit score off of the board the score showed qqq qqq until it first popped up with detroit leading qqq qqq in the third period the blues already led qqq qqq at the time i told them i did n t want to see the score i did n t want to know the score berry said i felt we had to win the game and that s the approach we took if minnesota took a lead berry feared the pressure of having to win might bother the blues if detroit led he worried the blues might quit until the announcement the blues played splendidly shanahan got the crowd going at qqq of the first period scoring his qqq of the season then miller and bassen took charge late in the period with the teams playing four on four miller broke in on left wing deked defenseman roman hamrlik and beat former blues goalie pat jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with qqq seconds remaining in the period then just qqq seconds later bassen rifled a long slap shot past jablonski after defenseman rick zombo intercepted a tampa pass in the neutral zone bassen made it qqq qqq just qqq seconds into the second period scoring on the rebound of bret hedican s shot the goal gave him his first two goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend last year bassen befriended young oliver mulvihill who died of a rare form of cancer at age qqq on feb qqq i was thinking of my buddy oliver bassen said he s in heaven now and i know he was watching i know he s happy miller increased the blues lead to qqq qqq on a break away goal set up by zombo at qqq then steve maltais broke curtis joseph s shutout just qqq seconds later making it qqq qqq less than a minute after the north stars final was announced tim bergland scored and cut the lead to qqq qqq but shanahan scored his qqq converting a pass from nelson emerson with qqq seconds remaining in the second period then it was all lightning adam creighton scored qqq seconds into the third period prompting berry to rest the overworked joseph guy hebert allowed goals to shawn chambers and danton cole in a span of qqq midway through the third period the goals by chambers and cole made shanahan s second goal stand up as the winner we were in there shanahan said the game was over we were in """,1
have you ever noticed that after a hockey player has been interviewed in between periods on a tv game that they usually get a goal or an assist can you explain this or is it that they usually talk to stars more than regular players which explains the hight percentage of results after just wondering how everybody else thinks about this or if they do nt care about this trivial nonsense ttyl tom,1

um what eddie murray was a superb first baseman for a long time winfield as produced consistently for almsot qqq years and excellently on several occasions dave kingman s best year was like darryl strawberry s typical year with the mets darrell evans too did a whole lot more than just hit homers which is all that kong did whom are you talking about yes eddie murray is marginal but that s because he s qqq years old he was n t marginal for a long time not smith has hung around for a long time and fielded the position better than anyone else ever has yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago in case you had n t noticed one of his two mvp awards was as a centerfielder like whom there are many players in the hall who are n t anywhere near as goos as the guys you re running down that s already the case by some standards but the bad players in the hall are all from the qqq s and qqq s recent picks have generally been excellent no but who cares was stan musial anywhere near as good as babe ruth not really but he obviously belongs there the hall has generally had about the top qqq of major leaguers as more players come through the game more will be in that top qqq and yes it s pretty easy to argue that smith yount evans winfield etc are in the top qqq dave kingman on the other hand was a liability throughout most of his career of course garvey has n t gotten a lot of hof press so i do n t know what you mean as for ryan is his w l better than morris that s what a lot of voters tend to look at and morris was awfully good for a decade and does n t lead mlb history in walks allowed either .,0

no patrick roy is the reason the game was lost and ron hextall is the reason quebec won everybody said it would come down to goaltending that goaltending was the key etc etc well the key does n t quite fit if you re montreal the dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call but let s face it he literally left his feet to throw an elbow blaming stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow he even saw the whole shot dammit besides stewart evened things up a bit by calling a quebec penalty in ot montreal played a solid game although they still do n t know how to clear traffic in front of the net the loss of schneider will hurt even more normally i would say that any team that blows a qqq lead with less than five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time in a playoff game especially needs to be smacked upside their collective heads but i do n t think this was a team loss although keane should have been able to clear the zone just prior to the first quebec goal roy is paid big money to play he looked like a player in an industrial league on sakic s shot demers should start racicot in the next game if not that he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two and maybe this article if possible i did n t think the wrap around was as bad as the second goal i also did n t think scott young should have gotten around the defender ca n t remember who in the first place but you are correct it should n t have gone in regardless yep moog looked bad on mogilny s goal with five seconds left in the second imo how about neely though holy shit what a player speaking of great players man oh man can quebec skate i have n t seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time watching them break out of their zone especially sundin is a treat to watch they remind me of the red army but i still hate the team on the rest of the games did n t st louis winning goal come on a powerplay penalties will cost chicago dearly especially against detroit same goes for calgary very very undisciplined when marty mcsorely is waving guys to the bench to avoid fights you know something s up new jersey was overmatched terreri s heroics notwithstanding mario is unbelievable and jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs but i hate that team anyway .,1
yes but as has been mentioned many times before the islanders play at the talent level of their opponent since hartford is pitiful the islanders played pitiful since pittsburgh is great the isles will most likely play great this is most likely due to inexperience and very poor shooting to greg yes i have noticed that the islanders could n t hit the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of it does anyone have shooting percentages i do n t know if that would help since they often miss the net completely but it might shed some light on the subject and my playoff pool is running exact rules to be posted tomorrow but do n t hesitate to send in picks keith keller let s go rangers let s go quakers kkeller mail sas upenn edu ivy league champs !,1

while i can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around gant was n t ordered back in the box sooner he was ordered back immediately as soon as he stepped out hirschbeck told him to get back in the box now gant does n t take a lot of walks between pitches the only reason he did then because he was very bothered by the call i expect his concentration was n t there yet and in a crucial situation i imagine it s best to be as calm as possible contributing factors would be gant s bad day at the plate bad year at the plate and the braves long scoring drought now it s pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in there you know the umpire is going to do something call for a strike throw you out etc gant was wrong but hirschbeck was more wrong in my biased view aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder what was the problem gant had a reason to want some time disputed strike call gant had n t been wasting time all game the game had been cruising along and was just over two hours old the score was qqq qqq with qqq outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position is there any reason hirschbeck could n t and should n t cut gant a little slack for no discernible constructive reason hirschbeck disrupted the game caused a five minute delay and materially hurt the batter in a key situation did he have a date to get to and i still wonder why terry was tossed earlier in the game dale j stephenson steph cs uiuc edu baseball fanatic,0

the last name is niedermayer as in new jersey s scott s last name because you guessed it they are brothers but rob niedermayer is a center not a defenseman i am not sure that the sharks will take kariya they are n t saying much but they apparently like niedermayer and victor kozlov along with kariya chris pronger s name has also been mentioned my guess is that they ll take niedermayer they may take pronger except that they already have too many defensive prospects .,1
buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains pat lafontaine was awarded the captaincy when mike ramsey was forced to give it up ramsey s now a penguin ramsey inherited it from mike foligno who s now a leaf he in turn had inherited it from lindy ruff who went i forget where ruff had it from perreault who retired so i guess that s where the streak started or did it after all danny gare was captain before him and he went to detroit jim scoenfeld gerry meehan and floyd smith are the others in reverse order last to first i was a bit young at the time so i m not sure of the fate of schoenfeld but he ultimately went to detroit and boston meehan went to vancouver atlanta and washington smith seems to have hung up his skates after buffalo but i do n t know if the captaincy was removed before or after that or how many games he played for buffalo this is actually getting fascinating captaincy in buffalo is a sure sign you re to be traded almost unless you re a franchise player .,1
whatever you say i think it s just qqq games into the season myself so i m going to wait a bit before calling names i expect that dave otto will be a really bad pitcher and i have no idea why simmons ever wanted him on the other hand i expect him to release otto if he does n t turn things around pretty fast btw otto s game score for that qqq ip stinker was only qqq which points out a problem with the method since otto s performance was infinitely bad and excruciatingly prolonged i think merced s rookie year was a bit flukey but are n t you willing to give him some more at bats and tomlin a few more starts before acting so gloomy no he did n t walk is a time bomb he has no stuff whatsoever and when the league finally realizes this it wo n t be pretty at all do n t be so fast doughty is the guy who signed steve buechele which was a move that threatened to bury kevin young in the minors meanwhile i m not sure whether doughty or simmons signed martin as a six year free agent before the qqq season twice through the rotation and you ve given up yikes but so has his age at least in baseball terms the useful half life of a qqq year old injury prone catcher ca n t be much longer than a year but he wanted to be a dodger and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous qqq i do n t think there was any chance for the bucs to sign him he certainly was n t last year hey that s the skates smith package deal anybody who acquires lonnie for his defense or base running particularly at this stage is a real weirdo if that s the goal of the team ownership than i do n t see why sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy i do n t know what he has or has n t said about revenue sharing so i ca n t comment there it s annoying but since leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain jeff king it was probably unavoidable meanwhile i think bigger accomplishments of simmons tenure were getting some value for john smiley not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year drafting well in qqq letting the rookies show something in qqq foley smith and candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts which means that even if fail it has n t done serious damage to the bucs future does this mean that the bucs lost the initial arbitration case i never heard the outcome of this when will the final verdict be in on this i m not sure who was the idiot in this case so i do n t know who to blame it might have been doug danforth after all in fact i seriously suspect it was doug danforth who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet btw i ve wondered whether my latest posts have been getting off site so if somebody known to impersonate e e cummings can see this would he drop me a short note ),0
i believe he was well out of baseball by the time he died uh he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car and smashing it into a tree as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his car and the speeding reported was over qqq mph reckless driving actually i had n t heard about this thanks i do n t know what you were reading or watching but i sure saw a lot about that and about dykstra s poker games most of the writing was along the lines of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was and how he d hurt the team by wracking himself and the catcher up etc espn raised questions about his judgement etc the print media here in the sf area questioned why disciplinary action would n t be taken against dykstra and one article pointed out that if lenny wanted to kill himself there were ways that would n t endanger other people s lives then there was dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it was etc mike,0
look how long the maple leafs and nordiques used similar logic not that they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams but the maple leafs and a certain dead man who was in charge were one of the cheapest teams in the history of the sport guess what they were immensely popular at the gate the nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the playoffs so many years in a row ha such humor they have major fan problems namely that on occasion some of them do n t make it home from the match the soccer fans tend to be fanatical much like the montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when they play pathetically jpc -,1
for an expansion team i m pretty sure i would go with the rings as long as their salaries and ages were n t too high i would want the fans to be able to identify the players i would like a championship attitude in the clubhouse as for larkin and griffin salaries aside i would have to consider which player is likeliest to contribute to a ws victory past performance age and attitude would all be integral to my decision i certainly would n t just haul out my copy of gillete and pick larkin as many others would and unlike many others who post to this group i hardly consider myself quali fied to make those kinds of decisions i have never been able to believe it about myself to tell you the truth it s like banging your head against a stone wall -,0

lou wanted morris all along the idiot giving the man qqq million to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded uzi with the safety off the only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it away i do n t see why people expect boston to finish sixth the bottom four teams last year were essentially tied boston in seventh place had qqq wins the yankees and indians tied for fourth place had qqq wins now i should think it is obvious that the red sox improved more than the indians or tigers basically the red sox are stronger this year at qqq dh ss lf and rf they have healthier starting pitchers so far at least and better relievers i see no reason why they should n t win qqq games meanwhile the indians are in shambles and the tigers still have no pitching they will win some qqq qqq blowouts but they will lose an awful lot of qqq qqq games too maybe the sox will play poorly win qqq games and finish fifth but i think third or fourth place is more likely .,0
detroit april qqq in a development that shocked most knowledgable observers the detroit redwings scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en route to a qqq qqq win over the best team in the nhl the toronto maple leafs the leafs could not be faulted as they completely dominated the inferior detroit squad and clearly deserved to win only the biased officiating of andy van hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior visiting side prevented an all out massacre of the wings by the league s best team alan,1

what sadist brought up this vein about malarchuk when i saw what happened i wanted to throw up and at the same time i was devastated since i thought that malarchuk would n t survive btw i believe he picked up an alcohol problem after before the incident to radically change the subject the caps must be having nightmares about the isles in overtime in the playoffs have they ever beaten the islanders in a playoff ot game this is lunacy the caps are such a sorry team in the playoffs they consistently choke against opponents who they should be beating losing two ot games in a row is not coincidence it s evidence of the choke factor .,1
as far as i know a save opportunity is when it is qqq inning or beyond and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game for example if it is the bottom of the qqq inning and clemens is pithching the red sox are leading qqq qqq and clemens has just givin up a hit so there is a man on first the batter and the batter on deck could tie the game with a homer if jeff russel came in the red sox reliever and finished the game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score he would get the save and clemens would get the win that s how i beleive it works .,0

i agree with nick what s the big deal about long games if you want to watch baseball there s that much more baseball to watch and yes baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves i suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games especially when it s coming from tv people has to something to do with advertising probably time wasted in the middle of an inning say by a batter stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves or by a pitcher walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts could otherwise be sold as advertising time .,0
i suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning an outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a lot of balls preventing both singles and doubles and also cut off more uncatchable balls turinging doubles into singles however a fielder who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies this means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles has anyone seen these players positioning do butler and felix play deep and lankford martinez and wilson shallow or is this a park effect i thought butler liked to play shallow .,0

i can understand your anger about the german audience i mean it was the finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the canadien ref called in the last period the germans got a match penalty and a qqq minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the german goalie got two minutes for delay of game for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd the resulting qqq skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point when the germans were starting to come up strong i am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in german sports events if you watch for example a tennis davis cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes because the crowd is so obnoxious but i have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries you should go to the us and watch the way they present the olympics on television or the soccer crowds in england or the finnish spectators at nordic skiing events i mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and i would rather see the best team player win and get cheared at i do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and i have to admit that in most sports the german national site is not my favorite team to watch the german soccer team is boring to watch for example but reading the above posting i think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing it is easy to talk of nearly all germans as nazis and nationalists that s the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against germany it is true that there is a great danger of re arising nationalism in germany but from my experience most of the people at least of the people that i know also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now why ca n t we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality eg all russians are communists all americans are capitalists all germans are nazis all fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries in my opinion your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you do n t seem to be different from the nazis you are talking about thomas,1

mvp biggest biggest suprise disappointment los angeles kings robitaille donnelly hrudey i would have chosen alex zhitnik for biggest suprise they did expect that he would become a great defenseman but i do n t think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his rookie year his speed skating ability and puck control is exceptional he is the one to watch on the kings i agree with marty mcsorely and warren rychel running a close second and third i am surprised more people have not noted knickle as the biggest surprise even though i personally do not really rate him well the biggest disappointment has to be carson though this is really unfair since too much was expected of him the second biggest disappointment is melrose with his adolescent handling of the goaltending problems putting hrudey on the bench for a month is just stupid it did not contribute to the team coming out of its slump mvp is surely robitaille .,1
just curious roger but since you have such a vast knowledge of the game and the league how come you have n t made a living out of it there must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field i m sure you d be of great help to say the leafs as an assistant coach or a scout or maybe try a career as a reporter or tv commentator i might be wrong of course and you already have .,1

a fine qqq year history came to a close tonight as the minnesota north stars or norm s stars whichever you prefer lost to the red wings by a score of qqq qqq the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen who netted two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to play tonight on the air on the stars tv telecast announcer al shaver the voice of the north stars stated basically that he will not follow the team to dallas shaver when asked by his son who was doing the broadcast with him what will you do now responded first i m going to get me a new pair of slippers then i m going to sit in my easy chair and watch the world go by thank you north stars and thank you al shaver for qqq years of minnesota memories .,1

the hart trophy was orginally awarded in a time where people did not think in terms of who was the best player rather in terms of who was the most valuable to the team and valuable to his team was not and should not be considered synonymous with best we are talking about a time when honour and attitude not measurable skills were the most important assets a player brought to his team his league and his sport this was before the onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was formerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory the hart trophy is not a prize it is an honour -,1
i m not quite sure how these numbers are generated it appears that in a neutral park bo s hr and slugging tend to drop he actually loses two home runs or do they what is equivalent average one thing when looking at bo s stats is that you can see that kc took away some homers normally you expect some would be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks or to be caught and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway but bo despite his speed hit very few doubles and not that many triples so i would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park felix jose has been a qqq player in a fairly neutral park i would offhand guess the qqq bo at around a qqq player maybe qqq not even close i d put him about there too note i had n t realized the media had hyped him so much i thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player and only so so at baseball he did only have one qqq qqq season and kc was n t winning note qqq i maybe have harped on this a bit in the past but there is a mistake being made by the sdcn s as they are known on this group with respect to players like bo and deion and lofton and perhaps others we find that if you look at a large group of players their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well their are some caveats the younger they are the less good the prediction the lower the minor league the less good i imagine the more recent the player has left college ball etc now of course this prediction involves quite a bit of error sometimes a player with poor mle s dave justice the qqq ventura becomes a star some hitters develop shane mack brian downing some do n t oddibe mcdowell mickey brantley this error involves real things there are real reasons why oddibe did n t hit and shane did it may who knows involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on but still you have this big pool of players and things work pretty well one of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players one thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them or almost all have spent a good deal of time playing ball their backgrounds are similar what has n t been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background is there some reason to believe that a bo or a deion or a lofton or a tony gwynn or an ainge or so on has such a different background that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly it has n t been established that you can use mle s with two sport players it has n t been established that you ca n t but then statistics is after all an art i personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about bo and deion and lofton look at those good but not great minor league numbers they say well what happens if those numbers simply do n t mean what they usually mean it might mean that ken lofton suddenly has a better year in houston than tuscon it might mean that deion suddenly has a better half year in atlanta than greenville then again it might not ken and deion might go right back in the tank this year live up to those poor mle s but you guys don t know what s worse you do n t know that you do n t and you do n t know that there are other players you wo n t know about injuries and lifting and wheaties again you seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal it s not it s got some error oh well bill guilford,0

the phillies salvaged their weekend series against the chicago cubs by beating them qqq qqq in a wild one at wrigley field sunday afternoon it was the phils only win in the three game series and was the first time the phillies have lost a series in the young season the phils jumped to a qqq qqq lead in the game thanks to qqq john kruk qqq homers and two wes chamberlain homers however danny jackson and the phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead mitch williams entered the game with the phillies leading qqq qqq however candy maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it in the qqq dave hollins hit a three run shot his first of the year to push the phils ahead to stay however in a shaky bottom of the qqq the cubs scored qqq runs and had the tying runner on base when the cubs pinch hit randy myers for bob scanlan they were out of position players and myers bunted into a double play to end the game .,0

oh yeah dave winfield marginal player guy did n t hit a lick had negligible power was a crap fielder and had no staying power dave winfield now entering his i believe qqq big league season is still a damn decent hitter admittedly his defense has slipped a great deal but in his prime he had a powerful arm and great range take a look at the stats i do n t know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman are similar players kingman was a one dimension power hitter he could n t field he ran like an anvil hit for a low average though if i remember right his obp was n t that hideous and for those who consider such things important was a absolute primo dick eddie murray yup only the best qqq baseman of the qqq s i know that mvp votes are conducted by mediots but given that he got jobbed out of the mvp he deserved in qqq it seems that he was n t overrated by the media lee smith hmmmm this one s actually pretty close he s had a s solid dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks wrigley fenway i d have to take a closer look at the stats it s been a while but it seems lee arthur is of hof caliber you do make a legitimate point about the hof credentials of relievers simply racking up a lot of saves does n t mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch too simply because minnesota and boston and for a month atlanta used reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one the equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves no way should homerman be in the hof imho darrell evans nice career actually a bit underrated kinda like ted simmons imho but not a hof er lemme ask you this who the hell playing the game isn t marginal now wait a goddamn minute here ozzie smith absolutely redefined the position of shortstop his defense was so good that he s won something along the lines of qqq gold gloves again gold gloves are mediot biased and a good argument could be made that larkin deserved one or two of ozzie s more recent awards but usually this is tempered by someone else in the early qqq s getting the gold gloves ozzie deserved earlier in his career ozzie s offense you ask good obp great speed numbers in a park which for most of his career depressed offense admittedly no power cept against tom niedenfuer but still a definite asset offensively yount qqq hits mvp at two different positions uh huh a real stiff his qqq was one of the great years ever by a player in recent memory and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks as far as ss numbers go he s a clear hof er imho well as far as garvey goes you re right garvey is a mediot candidate pushed because of his winning attitude a minor factor if one at all and his great defense no errors admittedly but the range of a tree stump garvey should n t be in the hof skyjack i ve said a lot of nasty things about skyjack in the last year or so but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about morris ability to win which is nothing more than morris ability to pitch when toronto to score tons of runs at this point morris is an average pitcher although from his early returns in qqq he may be damned close to done but in all fairness morris was a dominant pitcher in the qqq s for up and down tiger teams while qqq was obviously a great year for detroit the rest of the decade the team was generally in contention but not favorites morris career numbers are quite good and worthy of hof consideration ryan of course but be careful i guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about yount and smith being shortstops who hung around a long time after all nolan never won a cy damn he s just pitcher who hung around for qqq years his w l record is mediocre of course nolan s a hof er puck probably although he s got to play reasonably well for a few more years qqq years even good ones are n t enough to make the hof most likely that said i believe puckett will make the hof pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out barring something really tragic or sudden he s very popular in the media and with fans and legitimately has been one of the best cf s in the game since he joined the league i ve always liked the guy and i hope he does make it and in the end i think the puck will make it in but really it s too early to sell this debate comes up rather frequently on the net and believe it or not i never tire of it it s an interesting subject here s an off the top of my head list of potential hof ers from each team i probably left a couple of guys off so feel free to follow up i wo n t consider anyone who started playing after about qqq again too early to tell note these are all active players i m not counting recent retirees baltimore cal ripken should be a lock by now even if gehrig s record stands boston roger clemens might be a lock already which is amazing dawson detroit alan trammell and lou whitaker possibilities milwaukee robin yount discussed earlier new york wade boggs possibly mattingly long shot toronto paul molitor and jack morris possibilities kansas city george brett lock minnesota kirby too early to tell winfield lock oakland eckersley lock mcgwire too early rickey lock welch long shot texas the mighty nolan too early to consider canseco or strange cubs sandberg lock st louis ozzie lock lee smith probably new york murray almost a lock saberhagen obviously he s got to regain past form and most certainly not vince coleman despite what he ll tell you los angeles butler strawberry and hershiser are all long shots san diego tony gwynn pretty good shot colorado dale murphy a good shot ryan bowen just to see if you re awake before i get flames this is an off the top of the head list there s probably a few deserving candidates that i left off and i did n t include barry bonds will clark any atlanta starting pitcher frank thomas canseco mcgriff etc because i only considered guys who started playing before qqq e mail or post i almost fear what i may have started here .,0
i loved the abc coverage the production was excellent the appearance was excellent it had a sleek modern look this was the first time i heard thorne clement i thought they were great my only request is to leave al micheals out of this he annoys me i m hoping this leads to a regular season contract my guess would be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from feb april and then the playoffs i envy you canadians with your tsn cbc maybe i ll get a dish to pick up canadian tv how much are those things btw ?,1
in response to a debate about who has has a better season jagr of francis i think jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time stats do n t exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better is a useful statistic if a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals he must be doing something right it is especially useful to compare between teammates as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar ratings if they are equally good players it can be adjusted with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams i agree it would be nice for the nhl to keep more statistics but how useful are the ones that you suggest total ice time would be very useful it is a missing stat in jagr vs francis arguments from before somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless it would be a better stat for evaluating coaching ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones a very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who does n t recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player this stat would be much more flawed than and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent is a useful stat it is quite useful in evaluating player talent you are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed is a very positive thing and should be evaluated as such .,1

this comes indirectly from al morgani who works in the studio for espn hockey the management of espn was reluctant to leave the pitt nj game even though the outcome was certain because of fear of the wash ny game going to overtime when the caps scored with qqq left to tie the game al said he heard many people say f k espn is under contractual obligation to show baseball and could not broadcast the ot of the hockey game next year qqq will be introduced so baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey get off espn s back and stop posting articles on this subject there have been to many f n complainers about this game that it s making me sick .,1

npr s morning edition aired a report this morning qqq on hispanic latin american players in mlb and how they have many of the same problems faced by black negro african american players when they first entered the league however although baseball has adjusted to the presence of black players many hispanic players still labor under the stereotype of being fireballs hot blooded flashy the report also emphasised that despite the rantings my word of jessie jackson about baseballs discrimination against black players in its upper echelons baseball has actually done much better by black players than hispanic players another interesting point was the language barrier problem the reporter elaborated on an interview with ruben sierra which he gave in spanish to a spanish speaking newspaper reporter with the fact that there are maybe qqq major baseball writers that speak spanish despite the fact that spanish is one of if not the easiest languages to learn so easy that the author cormac mccarthy learned spanish at age qqq in order to research his book _ all the pretty horses _ yet few mlb organizations employ spanish speaking personel one of the exceptions being the oakland a s another point nearly qqq of latin american players have some african blood yet most report that they d never really felt black until playing ball in the us ironically enough it is the early presence of latin american baseball players in the major leagues that support the idea that baseball was integrated before the arrival of jackie robinson as many light black or brown latin americans were incorporated into baseball s,0

take a look at the standings it s real easy to get so focussed on minutinae and forget that the giants happen to be in first place if it s working you do n t screw it up by changing things just because you think it ought to be different some folks like to argue about theoretical details i prefer to watch teams win when the giants slip to third then we can talk about how to re arrange the batting order until then i think it s stupid to focus on what s wrong for the simple fact that it s working as it is in the majors i do n t follow al so i wo n t comment on majors in the nl if i had my choice of any qqq in the league for my team it d be clark and i d hit him third my fantasy team has both grace and murray on it because i ve never been able to get clark i d take any of the three without hesitation in real life but i think clark is it williams not even close i much prefer his defense but when he is n t headcasing it matt has a good solid swing and some real punch if he drops to qqq then he wanders out of cleanup but according to the latest baseball weekly he s hitting qqq and in the last week hitting qqq that s not exactly chopped liver mostly though the giants are winning and frankly as long as that continues it s rather silly to second guess their strategy but evidently some folks would rather be right than be first .,0

secretary qqq qqq qqq washington april qqq following is a transcript of remarks by president clinton to the university of maine black bears ncaa division i hockey champions the rose garden qqq a m edt the president good morning ladies and gentlemen it s an honor for me to welcome the university of maine black bears the winner of the ncaa division i hockey national championship to the rose garden and the white house i understand from senator mitchell that this is the first team from the university of maine every to win a national championship and we re glad to have them here i m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory coming from a state that is also relatively small in size but also filled with pride and tradition and community i can understand how the people of maine must feel about the black bears in our state people are still talking about the time we won the orange bowl over the number one ranked football team and that was back in qqq i m sure that qqq years from now the people of maine will as proud of this team as they are today you know in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey we do n t have a lot of ice laughter but after spending three months getting banged around in this town i can understand a little more about hockey than i did before i came here hockey is a tough game it s a hard hitting sport it does have one virtue though there s a penalty for delay of game i wish we had that rule in the senate laughter in government as in hockey leadership is important in the united states senate our team has a great captain the majority leader and the senior senator from maine george mitchell junior senator cohen looks so young i ca n t imagine laughter i m actually bitter about senator cohen because he looks so much younger than me on your hockey team the captain jim montgomery has done a great job he scored the winning goal late in the championship game leading you to a come from behind victory something else i know a little bit about sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities i share the pride that senator mitchell and senator cohen and congressman andrews and all the people of maine must feel for the black bears who have shown us all how to play as a team how to bring out the best in one another and how to come from behind i think it s important as i ask young people from around america who have achieved outstanding things in working together to come here to the white house to be recognized and appreciated by their country to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives we now have another role model and

was their judgment the fbi q is this a raid the president and i will i want to refer you to talk to the attorney general and the fbi i knew it was going to be done but the decisions were entirely theirs all the tactical decisions q what did you and senator mitchell talk about this morning q any chance for that stimulus package the president senator mitchell ought to pay my quarter laughter i was in there laughter senator mitchell you have to pay that quarter the president i was ready laughter senator mitchell he s worth a quarter any day q any chance for your bill sir the president we talked about what was going to happen this week in the senate and about what other meetings we re going to have for the rest of the week we only had about five minutes to talk and we agreed we d get back together later around noon and talk some more q senator dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise the president well i know he did but look senator dole and a lot of the other republicans now in the senate voted for the same kind of thing for ronald reagan in qqq and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of qqq emergency spending measures totalling over qqq billion when reagan and bush were president in those administrations and many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the american people back to work i do n t want to go back and revisit every one but you can do it you can look at the research there so this position they re taking is not credible we have a very tough five year deficit reduction plan all these costs are covered during that time and then some and the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for do n t have much of a history on which to base their position they ve got qqq years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the american people back to work so i think we ve got a chance to work it out and i m hopeful we ll see what happens today and tomorrow i m feeling pretty good about it the press thank you end qqq a m edt qqq,1

i do n t actually have the answer to this one bosio after walking the first two batters retired qqq for a back end perfect game how many other games including extra inning games have seen a pitcher retire qqq straight excluding official perfect games the only other instance of this i know about for sure is the famous ernie shore game which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in cooperstown shore came into the game when boston pitcher babe ruth got thrown out for arguing over the first batter walk shore picked him off and retired qqq straight after that matt wall wall cc swarthmore edu hey i got ta job here ok ?,0

hey folks saw the giants play ball at the stick saturday april qqq it was the game where pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two out two run homer to right to win it it was n t the game where the fans threw the give away fotoballs onto the field in response to the homer too bad huh well the stick is still cold the saturday game ended at qqq and it was cold then i ca n t imagine night games in april at the stick the wind kicked up a little too and i got this idea at most games there s a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on the field a lot of the time i propose a kid s clean up corps composed mainly of qqq qqq year old kids who would love nothing better than to run out on the field in the fifth inning when the guy in the toro smooths the infield and grab the trash it might not be glamorous but at that age i probably would have given anything to be on the field with the ballplayers everybody wins here whaddaya think ?,0

do n t you guys think so i mean c mon what the heck are women doing even thinking of getting into baseball they cause so many problems just look at lisa olson remember that feisty reporter that entered the new england patriots locker room she started crying like a little girl i just do n t think women belong in a man s sport before you smart guys flame me for this i know the given example was about football who cares it still applies to other male sports how can we have women umpires jeez look at pam postema just because she s a woman everybody on the face of the earth thinks it s great that she s getting an opportunity to ump if you even watched the games and had an iq greater than that of roast beef you d see that she is not nearly as good as most aaa umpires besides she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a foul tip off of wade boggs bat or jose oquendo s bat either way there are too many complications .,0

last night during a sharks broadcast commissioner bettman was interviewed during the first intermission he made no bones about it the expansion to qqq is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that the current allotment of qqq are fully stable this means that cities looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until one team in some location fails or looks to relocate this is good imo there s no sense in expanding if it only means more failing franchises are in the mold .,1
i ve noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict the marlines to finish ahead of the cubs how first base grace vs destrade could destrade be the second coming of cecil fielder i doubt it if destrade performs to the height of expectations then even otherwise edge to cubs second base sandberg vs barberie no contest sandberg will be back may qqq edge to cubs a big edge shortstop vizcaino vs weiss vizcaino is excellent defensively but is an automatic out at bat weiss is n t much better with the stick even third base dave magadan vs buechelle magadan has a higher obp and is a better hitter buechelle has more power and is better defensively i think edge to florida catcher santiago vs wilkins wilkins is ok but santiago is better edge to marlins left field conine vs maldonado wow qqq for qqq yesterday i know conine has potential i watched him play at omaha the last couple years until he actually proves himself i give maldonado the edge however like at qqq this is position where florida might be even or better if the player there has a huge year center scott pose vs wilson may edge to may even if wilson hopefully the cubs will use may and save wilson for pinch running and the like may is n t ken griffey jr but he will hit qqq with qqq homers if he plays full time right felix vs sosa felix jose has occasional power and a bad obp so does sosa but sosa also has speed and a good glove edge to cubs starters aquino armstrong hammond a lot of fifth starters here the cubs wo n t remind anyone of the brave staff but morgan castillo guzman hibbard is average to ok better than the marline edge to cubs middle relief even the cubs have some decent middlemen and so do the marlins carpenter anf klink or decent but so are assenmacher and mcelroy closer a healthy harvey is a big edge to the marlins meyers is decent but no harvey of course the cubs may have a few more games to save look for qqq saves qqq blown from meyers and qqq saves qqq blown with a better era for harvey edge florida overall an edge to chicago neither of these teams will threaten to win anything of course e msilverm nyx cs du edu go cubs !,0

usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season but the past few seasons have been incredible any thoughts on the new old reds uniforms i remember seeing a pete rose rookie card and unless i miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds the mets how about doc s performance today have reinserted the mets patch on the shoulder and changed the mets insgnia on the front of the jersey to my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since qqq and it reminds me a little of the dodger logo many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform or at least uniforms that look more traditional phillies reds expos white sox padres etc and the once bright colors have been altered to gray the trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years as opposed to the cookie cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties with salaries now reaching unbelievable highs no one in the comissioner s office and inter league play on the horizon it s nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be .,0

i ve never seen a game where one player has committed qqq penalties something like this would require more attention by the referee but you re creating a scoring opportunity where there might not have been one before i can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls but it s obviously easier to score in basketball there are more opportunities if a basketball team scores qqq points that s at least fifty chances made the average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game and this is a total guess is probably around qqq and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe qqq of them you have some good ideas concerning the other penalties but i think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with also later in the post you talked about how boring the nba game you attended was that play was stopped too often would n t your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game ?,1

that s a good way to put it it s a quiet confidence i do n t feel like i have to defend this team anymore the devils are a puzzle to me they have long been one of the few teams i always dreaded playing their d is n t quite what it used to be but they still usually play us pretty tough i just ca n t figure it out at least last night they mounted an attack bernie nichols was interviewed after game qqq on the late news he was shaking his head in disbelief over barrasso saying that tommy is like another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him then he got this far away look on his face his voice started trailing off and he said it just is n t right it just is n t fair and he tried to muster a smile as far as coaching goes a pens islanders match up should be pretty good one guy i feel sorry for in all of this so far is chris terreri i m sure tom barrasso knows how he feels for so long tommy would look up and not have a teammate in sight terreri s teammates really left him out in the cold in the first two games .,1

now this is a legitimate point baseball is entertainment and i have no quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than others regardless of their win value personally i m a huge fan of the slug bunt i doubt it s a high percentage play but i get a big kick out of it i am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that galarraga s inability to defer gratification is n t hurting his team because he is n t paid to walk or is an rbi guy or whatever i m not sure i used to think this was true but more and more i m becoming convinced that it s the other way around among players with the physical ability to hit the ball real hard the patient ones are the ones who get the chance to do it a lot let s break down the four basic categories of hitter according to whether they are power threats and whether they walk a lot power no power patient frank thomas brett butler barry bonds ozzie smith mark mcgwire craig grebeck babe ruth miller huggins ted williams billy hamilton rickey henderson eddie joost joe morgan mike hargrove impatient ernie banks ozzie guillen dave kingman shawon dunston joe carter andres thomas george bell jose lind kirby puckett devon white etc as far as i can tell all the categories are full it really looks like the two are independent nobody could possibly be afraid of craig grebeck at the plate and yet he walks quite a lot part of that undoubtedly is being small of stature but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of target at least qqq times out of qqq randy milligan is an even better example he s only shown noticeable power for one partial season but he walks all over the place despite his huge strike zone .,0

i ll post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted for most career k s with one team if it s not ryan perhaps steve carlton with the rangers hough was there for a long time in the qqq saves department maybe lee smith he should have at least a hundred with the cubbies maybe enough with either the rsox or cards then maybe gossage nyy and sd fingers mil oak do n t know about the homers steals dept in some other article mets trivia it could be tim leary in at least the losing to all teams maybe beating all of em too probably seaver and koosman fit too and in randy johnson s no hitter i think it was scott bradley the other half of the old mariner catching platoon who was behind the plate that night .,0
of course you can you just have to be careful about what conclusions you draw huh the qqq s and qqq s were the worst decades for great pitching grove vance dean and not a whole lot else as for the best all around hitters stat wise ruth gehrig foxx greenberg hornsby cobb etc all played before the qqq s stat wise the qqq s were a graveyard for hitters how do you know which ones do you consider great so sheffield also has better shoes more time between pitches you can run the comparison but there are lots of things to take into account well can we compare them or ca n t we why we can compare players to the standard of their era and we can keep in mind era to era differences without throwing up our hands in despair you have n t shown us what s un reasonable about the mantle sheffield comparison that you yourself did .,0
i believe we are down to two the qqq and the qqq i do n t remember a qqq but rather a qqq anyways it s gone now the period length is a minimum not a maximum you can keep a guy on the qqq for as long as you want if he s still certified as injured the player must be periodically re evaluated to determine if he s still injured thus you can not park a player on the dl who maybe is out of options and you do not wish to expose to waivers if you get someone qualified for the qqq that reduces the frequency of re evaluations there is no longer i believe any limit to the number of players you can place on the dl when there was you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between the lists king sparky banaian no taxes no new taxes kbanaian pitzer claremont edu no old taxes we are taxed dept of economics pitzer college enough rep alan keyes latest qqq gdp forecast qqq please run alan ),0

nonsense i quite clearly state that it was greg that made the claim that gainey never made an error and he made the claim read below from rec sport hockey thu apr qqq qqq qqq from gballent hudson uvic ca greg ballentine message i d qqq uvic ca nonsense deleted gainey is the best defensive forward ever i stand by that assessment he was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame did you ever watch him play he never made a technical error more nonsense deleted to knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious your hockey education is not my responsibility he was just another player to laud him as anything more i find bothersome i hated the habs i hated lafleur until i realized that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever skate in my lifetime why would anyone talk about gainey did he play hockey at a high level was he any good if not why would you bother to bring jc up i am talking about hockey players here if you ca n t follow the conversation do n t follow up as i said previously it is not my responsibility to educate you sure two journeymen big deal neither one of them is worth discussing that is an excellent idea and if i decide to waste any more time responding to any of your or greg s postings then i will be sure to implement that very macro tarasov claimed that gainey was a hockey god and greg ate it up and that is what this thread is all about if you did n t know that then why are you responding and as for blanket disregard for these individuals i can remember leaf teams purely populated by such individuals winning four stanley cups teams no one ran around telling us that george armstrong was the best hockey player in the world right i had to get to the end of your posting before i realized you were a complete joke in the future if you are going to respond to my postings i would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize cordially as always rm,1
