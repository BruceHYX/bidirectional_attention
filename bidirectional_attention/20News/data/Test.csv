first happy birthday val second espn s affinity with patrick has probably more to do with the travel production costs for a once a week nhn national hockey night affair espn abc owner capital cities is a company known for being quite thrifty with minimal overhead costs it s quite possible that jim schoenfeld may be working for doughnuts gary thorne and bill clement are both nj based and the rest of espn crew resides in the suburban ct with a very close proximity to tri state area plus it makes sense in terms of solid hockey following in the northeast corridor pa ny nj dc maryland whereas in the adams you have only qqq based teams out of which qqq and hartford are not in qqq us tv markets .,1

if my powerplay was as bad as montreal s i d be thanking stewart for calling as few penalties as possible quebec s powerplay is lethal and it is to their advantage to have a penalty filled game where they can clean up with their superior powerplay montreal really lost that game and game qqq because patrick roy is well on his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs the man is truly overrated quebec has scored six goals on roy and four perhaps five were quite stoppable .,1

these people were very silly any team that gets to the world series can win the world series and anybody who ever expects a sweep is crazy if you put the best team in baseball in the series against the worst team in baseball the worst team would win at least a game most of the time and very well could win the series though the odds would certainly be against them .,0

from where i come from in canada borshevsky sounds more canadian than smith anyways crawl back into the hole you crawled out of the nba does n t care where they get basketball players from major league baseball does n t give a damn where they get baseball players from except cuba that is canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary supplier of players sweden finland the czech republic and slovakia are all relatively small countries and can not really produce players at a greater rate than they are already producing them and the potential influx from the former soviet union is severely blunted because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and will take a decade or two to recover and become a real threat and the us will just maintain its slow increase canada should continue to supply qqq plus of the top hockey players in the world for the forseeable future besides we need the european hockey market if hockey is to take its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world sports and since soccer is essentially boring unlike hockey canadians are under no threat the european numbers will soon saturate if they have n t already and by the time russia comes online again the nhl should be a world league and there will be many more teams to stock and many more jobs for canadian hockey players in the near team the percentage of canadians will mostly decline because of americans not because of europeans crawl into a hole and die .,1
amusing is n t it seems only the sdcns realize how much baseball is a team game combining efforts from every player for the win consider the red sox game last night the sox won qqq qqq in the bottom of the qqq who won the game clemens pitched a strong nine innings allowing only two runs ryan pitched a couple shutout innings though he needed some excellent defensive plays behind him to do so quantrill pitched a couple of innings gave up the go ahead run and got credited with the win when the sox scored two in the bottom of the inning looks like a team effort to me yet only quantrill got credit for the win how about the offense dawson and vaughn hit i think hrs early in the game without either one the sox would have lost in nine quintana led off the qqq with a solid single zupcic pinch ran for quintana providing the speed to go from first to third when cooper ripped a second single in the inning melvin avoided the dp getting the run home with a sac fly not much of a help but it was something scrub richardson then hit a double scoring the speedy cooper all the way from first hill s lack of defense helped cooper and zupcic were credited with runs melvin and richardson were credited with rbis but it seems to me that it was quintana s hit that set up the whole inning and did melvin really contribute as much as richardson furthermore people seem to consider rbis to be more significant than runs did melvin contribute more than cooper cooper provided the game winning baserunner and moved the tying run to third base with only one out assigning credit based on runs and rbis is clearly ridiculous you can argue that obp and slg do n t show you who came through in the clutch but r rbi do n t do any better at least obp and slg do n t claim to try to tell you that here s to the red sox who contributed to last night s victory all qqq of them !,0

eric roush writes funny i did n t realize mr tanner brought up bob knepper v pam postema in the first place thought it was someone named jacobs why if a statement is truly idiotic and is universally thought so the challenge is a waste of panting further challenges that have nothing yes nothing to do with baseball are wasting others time you got a problem with what bob knepper thinks let s hear it in some sort of categorical manner actually i question whether either knepper or postema are n t old news at this point although what i have read of postema s book is interesting i agree this far sez you that does not come out in what you say down the road here yo even elementary school children have had access to our postings albeit in an edited form you want them to hear you talk like this do n t you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think you like to do the same or do you want them to think you re some politically correct demagogue who s oh so sensitive ho hum plus you re here limiting free speech to some obscure newsgroup that i do n t read what bs you got a problem with what jacobs says what knepper thinks all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas more and better speech yours is the easy way out as for knepper ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of them you know that often the best copy for the news is the one that is n t pre prepared they know knepper has controversial ideas about women they pop some question about postema an interesting related question would be whether the two ever appeared in the same game off the top of my head i guess no if my guess is right knepper popped off about something that had nothing to do with him and postema gets a book for it and he does n t now why did n t i think of that rg,0
you obviously do n t understand how tv scheduling works espn had prior contracts to baseball to show monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance the nhl tv deal was very late in the scheduling process you normally have to do this one plus year out the nhl package was finished two weeks before the season started espn has shown tremendous commitment to the nhl by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could like the last minnesota game and putting stanley cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night but the bottom line is that espn can not break contracts at will they must honor the previous deals they made _ does _ have something to do with it especially if you risk a lawsuit for breach of contract with baseball so relax i m happy i do n t get sportschannel anyway .,1

detailed explanation deleted indeed you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement to rebut my opinion you have made an analogy with a game of chance your hypothesis assumes that the lotto players have no impact on the selection of the numbers and hence their ability to win well that s certainly true in lotto but it has absolutely nothing to do with the sport of baseball when you start down the wrong path you finish down the wrong path i repeat i do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting performance i do however think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance may for some players indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance and i think chris sabo is such a player the beastmaster,0

a reasonable umpire would have recognized that ron gant was disturbed with the call a reasonable umpire would have realized that there was a qqq game in progress with two outs in the ninth what ron gant did was try to regain his composure what a normal baseball player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument with the umpire and since you ca n t argue balls and strikes he would have been ejected from the game ron gant by trying to avoid such a conflict was penalized for showing some restraint incidentally a reasonable home plate umpire would not have been so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire as gant requested if the home plate umpire had appealed to first the first base umpire could have wrung up the strike and gant would not have been so upset if the call had been a ball and the catcher had requested the appeal it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help finally the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the so called efforts to speed up the game the game was played very quickly it was just at qqq hours when the stuff happened in the ninth and the only delays in the entire game had been the result of actions by the umpires other than deion having to clean garbage off the field .,0

"well the patrick division got a little more interesting last night the islanders lost in ot and the devils tied the pens that means if the isles beat the devils on friday the will meet the caps in the playoffs however i have some more comments on the islanders and hockey in general that i need to get off my chest first of all with the islanders back to back lackluster performances against the whalers one may think that the islanders are out of shape these guys always suck wind in the qqq period come on a little in the qqq and run out of gas too soon it is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost anyway the games was pretty wide open the isles still have tons of trouble scoring the whalers played a golie in is qqq nhl start i think his name was lenarduzzi sp his nhl debut was the tuesday tie against the isles like i mentioned before this guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while until he misplayed a mahlakov slap shot to go to ot i say it s because the isles do n t shoot correctly has anyone else noticed this also i think it is really a shame for hockey when i guy like mick vukota gets as much ice time as he does this guy has about as much hockey talent as jiggs macdonald who did play hockey i think anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties richard pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap and he s a defenseman he s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus minus this guy gets beaten all the time why the need for such enforcers not only do fights slow the game down alot but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game i ll be one of the few to admit i do enjoy a good fight once in a while but only when it s called for you know when a guy checks the goalie too hard in other words a violation of hockey ethics might cause you to get puched but there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the qqq and ot i mean come on already i m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down holding guys etc just becuase the referee does n t call it ot and late in the qqq should be a time for strategy not physical prowess trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost if you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it you do n t deserve to win in the first place just my honest opinion ,",1
catcher is their weakest position with the possible exception of second base they have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a well above average offensive player and acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team and they want to play olson and berryhill instead a catcher s defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his recent offensive level of performance thus mickey tettleton goes in the media from being a no hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb finger in two short years the rule does n t apply to perceived superstars who get the gold glove offensive transfer effect instead greg olson is probably considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he ca n t hit are n t they the same thing either that or just stupidity of course one could make the same sort of argument in other cases pete rose in pursuing ty cobb s record was a huge gate attraction and national media magnet the reds made a lot of money off that they also wasted the prime of eric davis that may be good business but that does n t mean i do n t loathe them for it .,0

you could be right then again you could be wrong this claim is completely unverifiable and untestable i d wager most of the braves fans on the net could name more than qqq players from their qqq season you could give away tickets to braves games however my dad and i were able to get great seats from scalper for face value which is n t exactly the sign of a hot ticket this is precisely why they were considered america s team even especially when they were bad you could see most of the braves games on cable you could do that for the cubs as well but the braves had better camerawork better announcers what would you rather listen to harry discuss the game or skip and pete discuss motoball and teams that were n t too much worse because of tbs the braves had a lot of fans outside of georgia at home in kentucky even though we were much closer to cincinnati there was as many braves fans as reds fans even in qqq you could actually watch the braves play you had to go to cincinnati to watch the reds i can go anywhere in america and watch the braves why i d guess that braves fans are more widely distributed than toronto fans dale j stephenson steph cs uiuc edu baseball fanatic,0

the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to death but i have n t seen anything in rsb yet gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run he stroked a line drive into the right field corner the ball cleared the three foot high fence and went into the crowd darryl racing over from right center got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence but he missed the ball a fan sitting in the front row wearing a mitt reached up and caught the ball home run now i ve seen the replay several times and i have concluded that darryl missed the ball and that the fan s glove was essentially behind darryl s several dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with strawberry what can not be disputed however is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing he was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch that exuberance disappeared immediately however when strawberry went into a tirade at the man all reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference and therefore of costing the dodgers a game shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch dodger stadium officials started to remove him from the park but then relented and just relocated him to another area in an interview after the game lasorda blamed the fan for the loss strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they do n t care about winning l a times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play was the fan wrong should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference or was he human and just reacting by the way he is a season ticket holder and on his request the dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the stadium where future interference is impossible others have questioned why darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of qqq rbi through the first nine games i question what he was doing in right center with a left handed pull hitter up and the game on the line had he been closer to the play he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball but i guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan the beastmaster,0

i was watching the dodgers marlins game yesterday and a couple of things impressed me first is that the way the sun was shining in miami it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball in comparison wrigley field in early april still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans the second and most important was the fans i like these guys gals i will admit i am a football fan first but i still enjoy baseball it was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the miami dolphins the way they were cheering i thought it was the afc playoffs of course opening day may have a lot to do with it but i really got feeling of electricity that i think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities baseball certainly needs a charge and i hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement we ll find out friday how denver bronco fans respond .,0

well since the oilers did n t win a heck of a lot of games i m not sure they deserve and mvp ca n t win without him however i d suggest kelly buchberger instead of dave manson who has had a brutal year his pick for the all star game notwithstanding as for biggest surprise i d say that buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his breakthrough year for him last year so he did n t really raise his game my suggestion would be shjon podein one of the callups from cape breton during the year he was quite far down on the depth chart in the oilers stable of prospects but made a big impact on the team he has qqq goals in his qqq games and is only qqq those are decent numbers for a third line player who was seemingly doomed to minor league oblivion the oilers coaching staff likens his style to john tonelli i think he ll be on the full time roster next year as for biggest disappointment you could name any of the players the oilers dumped for lousy production this year nicholls gilchrist tikkanen or even shayne corson but mellanby is n t far off andrew scott andrew idacom hp com hp idacom telecom division qqq qqq qqq ext qqq,1
i definitely do that s why i do n t like going to see games played on artificial turf well your idea of interesting differs from mine i think batting practice is interesting for example and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it i think the delaying tactics of batters pitchers catchers and managers are interesting because they re attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game of course the umpires can and should intervene when these tactics get out of hand as ryan robbins has pointed out there are rules that cover this one of the more fascinating things about baseball i think is its open endedness with regard to time you never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours or if it s going to go on until four in the morning likewise some games are action packed and some games are slow and lazy that s fine by me those folks who want constant action should watch the games on tv so they can channel surf and cater to their short attention spans .,0

i really do n t want to get into a didso didnot debate with you but this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement i did not say nor did i imply that i could predict the future you have inferred that my comments meant this and you have based your rebuttal of my comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in regard to clutch hitting sabo qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq samuel qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq that is your opinion that sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel the above data is for a qqq period ending last season last season samuel batted qqq while sabo hit qqq not park adjusted this season they are both hitting below qqq albeit sabo with more at bats i will agree that over his career sabo has been a better hitter than samuel but i will also remind you that samuel has been a better hitter in certain situations than sabo i did not predict that sabo would choke nor that samuel would get a hit i expressed my opinion that had i been the reds manager or even a reds fan that i would prefer to have samuel hit in that situation than sabo ah properly yes i see please help me what exactly is everything else that pointed to sabo i must say i was not aware of the publication can you email me the information regarding its availability and i guess i must apologize to all of those who have done extensive study on say supply side economics i did n t mean to insult you but i never did believe you were on the right path i m sorry for my contrary opinion position i also regret that i do n t have the ability to prove that you are wrong but you are it is what it says it is the second is your statement not mine well actually i have n t yet but i m not finished looking that is i have n t yet found someone who hit significantly below his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years qqq qqq and then reversed that relationship in qqq nope sorry but if you were interested in a reason why i expect chris sabo s ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could if you were interested in a reason why i expect joe carter s ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next i think i could but you re not interested in that because you think that those conclusions could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire baseball population and they ca n t be the problem here is that i do believe you i accept your work i believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based on prior clutch history is meaningless no better than a coin toss i actually do accept your work as it happens i also have an opinion that in certain situations for certain players a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in projecting future player performance for that player and chris sabo is one such player well since i defer to your statistical wisdom i think i must have an open mind now we have to pose the same question to you the beastmaster,0
rogers is the one batter lefty in the bullpen dusty has also said he trusts rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where beck is unavailable so you might see a couple of saves for kevin then again if any of the regular rotation falters rogers is a possible candidate to start though this would appear less likely now that dave burba did well in an emergency start .,0
that s the trouble what peak years he wavers between excellent and very good with no real bell shaped pattern in there qqq was a fine year qqq and qqq were merely really good with the yankees qqq i think was the best that was the one with the qqq ba of course qqq was n t bad either he s been in the bigs since qqq with a one year intermission for surgery though he does n t have the mix of skills that pete rose did he s like pete rose in one way he s not a natural hitter winfield s swing used to be the ugliest thing in new york and that includes the gulf western building but his sheer athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot fascinating player to watch even now not obviously great in any one way but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising levels .,0
okay here s some gripe ing griping whatever i live in santa barbara for reference i think okay abc showed the kings flames fine yawn espn through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game showed the red wings toronto game cool but i swear that the advertisements all week long had said that espn would show pitt nj on tuesday and bos buff on thursday i raced home from work early qqq pacific to catch the game but alas it was the boston buffalo game and then they promised that they would show the pitt nj game on thursday overnight they changed their mind i did n t mind that much i watched the game hockey is much better than no hockey during the game their were no video highlights from the patrick division what the hell was going on at least they should show video highlights of the other games especially the nyi caps game that was so close my father lives in bowling green kentucky bumbf ck egypt got to watch the pens game on espn i just do n t get it the biggest problem is that buffalo or boston fans who did n t want to see the pittsburgh new jersey game qqq will turn on their tvs on thursday and see the pittsburgh new jersey game qqq instead of the buffalo boston game qqq at least in my case i just had to wait qqq more days to see my game if i were a big boston or buffalo fan and i missed the game on tuesday due to false advertising on the part of espn i d be mad as hell oh well hopefully we ll get better coverage next year or something matt coohill,1
i do n t buy this at all roy was the reason the game was tied and that would not have been the case had dionne kept his cool hextall gave up qqq very questionable goals himself both dionne s and bellows shots were misplayed by hextall but just because his gaffes were early in the game no one seems to care roy stood on his head for the first qqq minutes of the game when the nords were rushing from end to end kamensky s mini break after the tying goal and the first shot by young in ot were both excellent chances stopped by roy roy outplayed hextall for most of the game but roy becomes the villain and hextall the hero because roy s team did n t make full use of their opportunities hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces he played very well but the haller shot off the post in ot the rebound bouncing over bellows stick the brunet breakaway the qqq chances for leclair all those opportunities were not finished off by montreal and it cost them hextall was n t particularly brilliant on those plays sure no excuse but it was just the qqq goal the timing stank but against an explosive team like quebec they gave them qqq opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary i disagree roy played well because he was n t screened the whole night the defense for the qqq time this season played remarkably keeping sakic nolan and sundin out of the slot most of the night this most certainly was a team loss leclair missed his opportunities as did bellows and brunet dionne took a bad penalty damphousse and lebeau were silent carbonneau and savard were a step behind all night roy gave up the bad goal roy by no means can be singled out for this loss and hextall did n t on dionne s goal please roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies and he still is in the top qqq when you consider the defense or lack of one that played in front of him for most of the season the montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the habs they are no better than uninformed fans why should they read the papers they played qqq minutes of burnsian hockey to shut down quebec all they need tonight and for the rest of the series is the extra qqq red light to face quebec rubbish that s a guaranteed way to end the series qqq qqq who would be taught a lesson by this the fans the media and racicot perhaps certainly not the rest of the team if you mean the goal should never have gone in because there should never have been an ot then i agree but the goal itself was a great piece of work by young roy had both the near and far posts covered but young flipped the puck up under roy s arm as he wrapped around the net not a bad goal at all .,1

bowman is the genius johnson is n t bowman is a great coach johnson a very good one however bowman is really not a modern coach and patrick s solution of having him only run the team on game days and delegate most of the day to day responsibity to the assistants is a shrewd managerial decision on patrick s part imho bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at this time johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his group of players i would say we have been very lucky here in pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the change with the immense talent on the penguins roster this year a tougher bowman keeps the egos in check johnson on the other hand was able to inspire the younger inexperienced players to new heights both coaches have had different strengths both of which came at exactly the right time another person also mentioned that bowman is the perfect coach for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions how can you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also keeps the egos in check just a couple of ideas .,1

this is certainly not the case there is no significant ability toi perform in the clutch but clutch performance certainly happens every time there is a game winning hit the clutch pitching quoted above is something which happened not a claim that any particular player should be expected to be a clutch pitcher simple statistics tell me that there is a qqq chance an average clutch hitter would have this large a split the average decrease is qqq points standard deviation about qqq there will be such hitters in any league just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on tuesdays and there is only a very weak correlation qqq in my best study between clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather than any ability based only on this data i do n t see any reason to pinch hit for sabo or any other player who had been a poor clutch hitter in the past but there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch hit does the pinch hitter give you a platoon advantage any portion of sabo s clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a real ability even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting do you have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run do you have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves ?,0

nice try deepak but tough whaler squad should have clued you in to the fact that my leaf woofing was tongue in cheek if playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least qqq consecutive times in qqq days and hockey being the contact sport that it is some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season but that is only for some of the players many of the rest who have been playing with injuries who miss their families or who like grant fuhr would really rather be playing golf do n t really give a damn of course i ca n t say this for sure but i believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and i do n t think that hockey players are above having what i consider typically human attitudes with the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing money by participating in the playoffs the ones who regard the playoff take as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs now i know some of you are going to come back with winning spirit and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all while they may love to play the game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose which is to make a decent living of course the coach is a professional as well and part of what he is being paid to do is motivate the players so if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort the second season is after all merely an exhibition the true champions of the league are the division winners the teams that come out on top after the long struggle of the season the stanley cup playoffs merely accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and hot the emphasis on the playoffs with their sudden death appeal has been promoted by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind even if pittsburgh loses the playoffs we all know that they were really the best team in the league over the year they proved it cordially as always rm,1

does anybody in the pittsburgh area know why mike lavalliere was released last year i kept saying that slaught should get the bulk of the playing time that he was clearly the better player at this point but leyland insisted on keeping a pretty strict platoon and now he is released that does n t make any sense to me greg the story goes like this spanky is too slow if he were quicker he would still be here but with slaught and tom prince they did n t want to lose prince in order to bring up that qqq pitcher slaught is about as good as spanky and prince is coming along nicely do n t feel too bad for him he s still gon na get theat qqq over the next two years he ll be able to do most of what he wants to do .,0
stuff deleted ok here s the solution to your problem move to canada yesterday i was able to watch four games the nj pitt at qqq on abc la cal at qqq cbc buff bos at qqq tsn and fox and mon que at qqq cbc i think that if each series goes its max i could be watching hockey playoffs for qqq odd consecutive nights i have n t counted so that s a pure guess i have two tv s in my house and i set them up side by side to watch mon que and keep an eye on bos buff at the same time i did the same for the two afternoon games btw those abc commentaters were great i was quite impressed they seemed to know that their audience was n t likely to be well schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job they were quite impartial also imo .,1

for the second straight game california scored a ton of late runs to crush the brewhas it was six runs in the qqq for a qqq qqq win monday and five in the qqq and six in the qqq for a qqq qqq win yesterday jamie navarro pitched seven strong innings but orosco austin manzanillo and lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday how s this for numbers maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and navarro s era is qqq the next lowest on the staff is wegman at qqq ouch it does n t look much better for the hitters hamilton is batting qqq while thon is hitting qqq and has seven rbi the next highest is three the next best hitter is jaha at qqq and then vaughn who has the team s only hr at qqq another ouch looking at the stats it s not hard to see why the team is qqq qqq in fact qqq qqq does n t sound bad when you re averaging three runs game and giving up qqq game still it s early and things will undoubtedly get better the offense should come around but the bullpen is a major worry fetters plesac and austin gave the brewers great middle relief last year lloyd maldanado manzanillo fetters austin and orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place the starters will be okay the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around but the bullpen is a big question mark in other news nilsson and doran were reactivated yesterday while william suero was sent down and tim mcintosh was picked up by montreal today s game with california was cancelled .,0
matching the makarov offer was the only real mistake dave king has made this year i have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a qqq old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a qqq qqq million contract risebrough matched the offer on king s request and makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks not to mention that he s lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes i think makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract he s ineffective in calgary but he might be able to help a team like san jose with their shortage of talent if there s no takers and makarov does n t show improvement in training camp i think the flames will just bite the bullet and buy out makarov s contract and release him with his current attitude he is a detriment to the team .,1

during the local rockies broadcast the other day don baylor went out to bring in a relief pitcher and a graphic came up on the screen that it was the so and so sponsored pitching change i saw another game where the pinch hitter was sponsored at other times during the game rockies announcer duane kuiper was setting up the strategy that the defense might use with the expectation that charlie jones would jump in and discuss the situation but what does charlie do he read s a beer advertisement and leaves duane hanging duane s strategy proved prophetic these examples happen over and over on radio and t v braodcasts making them sometimes very boring to listen to i guess it s just a matter of time before a player sells his name to budweiser nike etc i do n t think it will be long until we hear nike budweiser drills it deep to left field chevrolet goes back back it s gone the apple macintoshes formerly the boston red sox are the qqq world champions back to work anthony m jivoin national center for atmospheric research rsf atd qqq p o box qqq boulder co qqq,0
and it is not hirschbeck s job to help gant with any of these difficulties if gant ca n t gather his concentration for whatever reason that just makes him all the more meat in the batter s box the umpire s job is to maintain flow of play gant is not entitled to time to regather his faculties nor is anyone else absolutely i think it d be more accurate to say gant was foolish if a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout games would last about nine fifteen weeks if jack morris or dave whiner stieb were pitching a disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out suck it up get back in the box and never badmouth the blue they re not going to change their mind and you re just going to come across as a pinhead which wo n t help you with the borderline calls ftr i never speak to umpires when i do n t know them personally nor do i glance at them or react to calls as a result i think i get more than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate because i have a rep of having a good eye actually there are a lot of negative connotations that go with that rep including copious questions about my masculinity party affiliation and sexual preference irrelevant he was wasting time then qqq because it s not his job qqq because setting the precedent of cutting slack there can easily extend to those qqq hour games kind of like the phantom dp gant hurt himself and the braves disrupted the game your biases are exposed and i m sitting here defending umpires and the sf giants which is like phyllis schlafly defending gary segura jack kevorkian and the swedish abortion team i believe terry said the magic word there are some truly quick ways to get tossed from a ballgame for a primer email me good ways to get tossed from a game qqq ask ken kaiser if he got his money back from nutri system qqq kiss rich garcia on the lips and say hi honey i m home qqq goose eric gregg qqq ask bruce froemming if his parents had any children that lived qqq get naked source the greg spira book of diamond ettiquette as told to peter gammons qqq collier press ),0
i disagree mcnall has demonstrated with gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well very few fans real istically expect the kings to do well this year although i do and yet they still go out to see gretzky this is the marketing strategy selling the game by selling the stars that is employed by baseball and notably the nba and this is the attitude that the new bettman mcnall leadership is bringing to the league they have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars timo salami and brett hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know are n t worth a damn and yet being benificiaries of marketing oriented coaching strategies have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer the very fans the nhl wants to attract that these players are indeed superstars it ai n t nearly so simple as this the casual fan does n t think about much at all can you actually find an adult with a qqq digit iq who believes that mcdonalds makes good hamburgers yes but apparently the rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi bilities has he he was hyped initially as a superstar but outside of one grey cup game he has done very little to maintain enhance that assess ment of his talents most argo fans probably feel the team would be better off without him cordially as always rm,1

perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that you have seen for most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity it was nowhere near the most exciting game unfortunately the instant replay is not used on hits at first i immediately thought qqq and a game because the hit _ looked _ much more severe from an intent to injure perspective than it was after seeing the replay i d say it deserved qqq qqq minutes for boarding it was careless any way you slice it if stewart had replay i do not think chaisson would have gotten qqq and the game this no call was bullshit i agree i admire stewart for letting them go but probert looked up saying where the hell is the penalty i ve never seen probert whine either he does n t need to now if probie decides to put wendel through the boards he s probably gone right this was also bullshit but once again no replay it was rouse btw i m really pissed that the linesmen did n t correct the call either it s b s when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake yes the calls you describe should not have the difference in a detroit loss i picked the leafs to win game qqq on emotion and adrenalin but the wings have no excuses for game qqq they should be the superior team the call that pissed me off the most was anderson getting qqq for putting his stick in somebody s eye that was _ the _ most dangerous stick infraction i have seen in a long time and everybody in the damn league _ knows _ he s an asshole when it comes to stickwork four lousy minutes bullshit call murray should send the tape in or a wing should hammer the living shit out of him .,1
deeply rooted rivalry ahem jokerit have been around since qqq and joined the top flight only in the early qqq helsingfors ifk have been around since qqq but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the qqq so i think you re exagerating here that s a rather bold claim in the light of how successful the canadian american olympic teams have been and they ve had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice the qqq olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team canada had eric lindros sean burke joe juneau and chris kontos another four or five have been deep subs in the nhl as for the yanks keith tkachuk scott lachance bret hedican shawn mceachern steve heintze ted donato joe sacco and bill guerin have been qqq line players in the nhl while robb stauber has done well for the kings in goal nothing more in fact i m sure that an all star team assembled from the best finnish league teams would do no better in the nhl than hartford or tampa bay currently are doing but what happens if _ all _ top class finnish swedish players gradually end up with helsinki stockholm as the north american based ones gradually retire and no canadian american team is allowed to draft new players from scandinavia here is what the hockey news scouts think of our nhl based players qqq qqq superstar qqq qqq star qqq qqq nhl regular qqq qqq nhl regular qqq qqq role player finland d jyrki lumme qqq d teppo numminen qqq d peter ahola qqq c jari kurri qqq c christian ruuttu qqq r teemu selanne qqq l esa tikkanen qqq obviously selanne s ratings would be higher today than they were in january sweden d ulf samuelsson qqq d fredrik olausson qqq d niklas lidstrom qqq d calle johansson qqq d kjell samuelsson qqq d tommy sjodin qqq d tommy albelin qqq c mats sundin qqq c thomas steen qqq r thomas sandstrom qqq r ulf dahlen qqq r michael nylander qqq l per erik eklund qqq l johan garpenlov qqq l mikael andersson qqq l jan erixon qqq this would be interesting clearly finland s top five players winnipeg s selanne numminen vancouver s lumme los angeles jari kurri and new york s tikkanen are right up there with any five man unit pittsburgh co have but i have my doubts about the home based finnish players the national team did well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of markus ketterer the goalie qqq qqq or the players listed above and luck there s presumably a lot of decent players in finland that would n t be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players however my guess would be that the finnish canada cup team would be a qqq team in the nhl sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in north america their points total qqq players is qqq seven more than ottawa s qqq top players combined if we estimate there are six more nhl regulars back home in sweden an all swedish team would assemble about qqq qqq skill points deducting some points from pittsburgh ny rangers and other teams that rely on swedish players the swedish team would finish in sixth place about as high as boston vancouver calgary and montreal on paper so the dynasty talk is n t completely unfounded here an all finnish all swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time wo n t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language and presumably play the wide open european variant of hockey rather than have to learn the north american checking game however if free agency becomes a factor the top scandinavian players still might end up playing for large market teams after a couple of years the same way edmonton s dynasty crumbled in the late qqq some fringe players likely will be drafted by other nhl teams as having an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all i d settle for a compromise prohibit all european teams from signing a north american during the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players after this the amateur draft should be open to anyone .,1

whoa what you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well he stores up mistakes that can be used at a later time ths is not so roy is the villain as you so succinctly put it because he allowed a very cheap goal if you think roy outplayed hextall perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first qqq qqq minutes of the third period nhl goaltenders _ make _ some great saves if they did not they would not be in the nhl in the first place i do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time even though they are occasionally required however when it comes to a routine shot like sakic s especially at such a crucial time in a game i do n t think there are any legitimate excuses i am not arguing that hextall was brilliant i am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result in a goal in a one goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as just the qqq goal i have not defended dionne for taking the penalty either in fact i think it was a boneheaded move but it led to _ one _ goal only and montreal had a _ two _ goal lead my main concern is the second goal what you say about the skaters is absolutely true but realize that the game was effectively won you could watch any hockey game in fact you could watch any sporting event period and spend hours discussing the what if s w r t missed opportunities they are not important when the final result is decided if i get the time soon i ll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky montreal bounces and a list of quebec offensive screwups montreal was _ leading _ with a minute to go the goalie is the last line of defence and i will grant that extra attention is focussed on him sometimes without justification but roy gave up a lousy goal and a team can not afford such a goal who cares of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play i could do a hextall critique if you d like but if you re going to assess his performance keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times for the record i did not say that roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league in fact i agree that he is i assume you are referring to me however i have pointed out that i think the loss can be blamed on roy i have not said he sucks nor do i think i ve made any other derogatory comments if you regard objective and informed fyi observations as derogatory i really ca n t help you .,1

major league baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter attention spans i e the football crowd invariably all the arguments from people who do n t like to watch baseball on t v say the same thing the games are too long and too boring baseball is trying to find a way to shorten the games for wider t v appeal if you look at it though baseball games last around the same amount of time as football games the difference is that there is more action in that duration in football games perhaps if there were more action in baseball games you would get more of those fans to tune in anyway coming up with a solution to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult on soapbox yet another reason to get a commisioner now since it s obvious that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in nebraska off soapbox steve,0

i know it s very trendy nowadays to dump on morris but let s give credit where credit is due it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris last year when the team went qqq qqq for the month of august and all the other starters were being shelled and milwaukee was making a charge morris went qqq qqq with a pretty good era i ca n t remember exactly also let s not underestimate the importance his qqq innings to save the bullpen every fifth day if he did n t help us win the al east forget about the pennent and the world series his run support was high qqq runs but so was stottlemyer s qqq runs and he won only qqq games i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of qqq qqq and qqq qqq ballgames but this is to his credit he pitched only as good as he needed to be when he was up qqq qqq in a ballgame he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out i hate this expression an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down but morris being a veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball by saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra i hate this too when the game was on the line yes morris is crapping out big time this year but let s not change history to suit the present btw i think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a veteran pitcher which cito would never do but his era is qqq how much more can he be embarrassed ditto !,0

imo any good player should score on power plays because of the man advantage very good power play scorers tend to become overrated because their point totals are inflated by power play points tends to expose these overrated players such as brett hull john cullen and dave andreychuck given the opportunity to play power play consistently any player can inflate his totals .,1

in any case i think viola would have made a better signing why viola is younger and is left handed how many left handed starters does toronto have well i agree that viola is a better signing however why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters i understand lefthanded spot relievers even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters i just do n t understand why people insist on lefthanded starters unless there is a park effect e g yankee stadium most batters in mlb are righthanded so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters i guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to lhp s than rhp s however this is probably only a factor in the postseason because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season i think you just want the best starters you can get regardless of whether they are lefties or righties lefthanded starters tend to have higher era s than righthanded starters precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties or perhaps because of the platoon advantage am i missing something here ?,0
would you say the same thing about the dodgers in qqq or qqq true cone is probably as good as drysdale and they have no koufax but still these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals with lots of low scoring games etc and they did n t use relievers whereas jeff montgomery is having a super season for them that being said i still picked them qqq or so but i think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting there s more of a chance of that i think than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching at least to me i wonder though which one do you people think would do better a team with johnson koufax in his prime seaver carlton and young in no real order as the starters with sutter fingers and lyle in the bullpen but with a puny offense assuming good defense like mazeroski maranville etc or a team with poor pitching but with an offense of cobb carew ruth gehrig mays schmidt wagner and bench again you pick the order i would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons end even the best hitters can succeed only qqq of the time in their best years but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts taking all the players in their prime they might throw qqq shutouts in a year and all the offense would have to do is get qqq run across i wonder if someone with stratomatic or something could plug such all time teams into a regular season have it played and report the results i would love to see that .,0

there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans i feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages and of course they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time another thing that bothers me is the points system percentages as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative when i look at the nhl standings the first thing i have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand which is almost always the case some will object to percentages claiming perhaps that it is an americanization of the sport but i feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is american or not is irrelevant even if orr could n t have contributed without the likes of norris you would have to agree that norris could n t have contributed without the likes of orr and taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made the more meaningful contribution it does n t look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it -,1

that s not inner calm it s boredom and it s being spoiled the arena s been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just take winning for granted it s been seemingly forever since the team lost and we ve forgotten what it s like to feel real excitement and surprise at victory at least last night there was some excitement the pens did n t have it wrapped up before the game was half over like the previous two games i m not sure if nj just rose up and played better or if the penguins just started to play down somewhat probably it was somewhere in between new jersey seemed much more aggressive last night in the pens end they did much more swarming around which at least kept an element of suspense in the game no question that billington helped make it more interesting also claude lemieux did n t help the cause any though with his ejection early in the game so who s going to start in the devils goal for the final game sunday sorry i could n t help myself .,1

minor point shea stadium was designed as a multi purpose stadium but not with the jets in mind as the tennant the new york football giants had moved to yankee stadium from the polo grounds in qqq and was having problem with stadium management the city did not own yankee stadium until qqq the idea was to get the giants to move into shea when a deal was worked out between the giants and the yankees the new afl franchise the new york titans approached the city about using the new stadium the titans were playing in downing stadium where the cosmos played soccer in the qqq because shea stadium was tied into the world s fair anyway the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the world s fair like they were doing with the mets so the deal was worked out i m under the impression that when murph says it he means it as a regular goer to shea it is not a bad place since they ve cleaned and renovated the place remember this is its qqq year !,0

there are many teams in the nhl who have taken a liking to russian players the whole russian strategy is not specific to detroit or to devellano who was gm before murray what the previous gm also did was to trade away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams most notably in my memory murray craven who had a few very good years with philly after leaving here also it s not the volume of trades that will necessarily improve a team but the quality of them trading adam oates for bernie federko was just plain stupid even if federko used to be a great player at one time most of murray s trades have worked significantly to the wings advantage with those that did n t being soured mainly by injury to the players involved such as troy crowder who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered put scotty bowman pat burns or any of the other better coaches in the league behind the bench of this detroit team and they could beat anybody .,1

the dodgers have been shopping harris to other teams in their quest for more left handed pitching so far no takers personally i think harris is a defensive liability and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays or at least been among the leaders sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day he can get the job done if sharpy played just one base every day say third he d also improve defensively wallach has helped tremendously on defense as has reed the improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff both astacio and martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years astacio lasted qqq innings the other day under similar circumstances the dodgers are turning double plays and keeping more balls in the infield than last year and piazza has also been great on defense he has thrown out qqq of qqq batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first wallach clearly has contributed to the over all improvement on defense but his offense is awful and he has cost the dodgers some runs but i do n t think he is as bad as his current average i suspect he will come out of this slump much as davis and straw seem to have come out of theirs .,0

the tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules overtime time games that are not shown what the hell kind of shit is this if that would have happened to the flyers if they were in the damn playoffs to begin with while i was watching i would have gone throught the roof however everybody is getting pissed off at espn but they are not the ones to blame they have prior contracts that they just ca n t simply break whenever they want to the n h l is to blame when they signed the deal with espn they had to know of this they had to know shit like this would happen since they would n t have complete priority the n h l should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at espn how can the n h l do this to its fans how dare they we are the ones that make the damn league exist and they ca n t even televise complete playoff games for us to watch they more i write about this the more pissed off i get we must let the n h l know that we expect a little better than this if anybody out there knows how to go about doing this let me and everybody else know well i had to get that off my chest and while i m at it mario is the michael jordan of hockey all that fucker has to do is fall on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least qqq last night in the qqq game between nj and pitt he was being pushed while skating across the front of the goal while trying to get a shot off the guy on him was doing a good job so he got off a weak shot but then he decided to fall to the ice then the fucking ref van helloamend called the guy for holding they replayed the play and my roomate who is clueless about hockey wanted to know what the nj guy did to get a call because it was so fucking obvious the nj player had both hands on his stick and no he did not trip him it is simple mario gets touched he falls to the ice automatic qqq but the thing that really pissed me off is pitt scored the qqq or qqq goal i do n t remember on the resulting pp and eventually won qqq qqq his diving calls makes a huge difference in the outcome of a game they got ta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking obvious that is not hockey it allows inferior players to bring down the level of the better players and allows inferior teams to beat better ones this has pissed me off for many years now and it has improved somewhat however during the playoffs and qqq periods the damn refs must misplace their balls because they sure do n t make any calls that show that they got any all agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed .,1

ted you re missing a vital point as roger lustig pointed out in a previous response the reason why schott was banned from baseball was because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on a constant basis such thoughts affected her hiring practices bonilla on the other hand was found to have mentioned this one word a single time if he had been known to go around criticizing homosexuals it would be a different story furthermore he is merely an athlete he does n t have to hire anyone as schott had to do dave pallone the former nl umpire who is an admitted homosexual has decided to assist in a protest before a mets game at shea he like you thinks that bonilla should be suspended from baseball pallone is hoping for a year s suspension in my opinion that s downright ludicrous as howie rose on wfan said if you start suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time under whatever conditions then you d probably have enough people remaining to play a three on three game now honestly if you truly analyze the differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article i would think that you d reconsider your thoughts sean,0

owen only has one error so far i believe that seriously underrepresents the harm he has done in the field owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches he will have a fine fielding percentage like always the problem is that he does n t reach anything that is n t hit straight at him this would n t be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to kelly gruber or robin ventura but the third baseman for the yankees is wade boggs who should have moved across the diamond last year i ve only seen one game abbott s first start but there were three balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality defensive players instead they were charged as hits against abbott .,0

off and on over the last several months threads about rbis and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can predict a player s rbis using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position risp that he bats with in the qqq model bill james calculated predicted rbis as qqq bases home runs this completely ignores the context which was all that qqq could do since context was unknown to it so i thought i d take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing rbi home runs to slg risp i ve started with team data using data from the elias s that i ve picked up over the years when a i could afford them and b i could stomach the thought of increasing elias s profits that gave me the years qqq qqq qqq and qqq i do n t have team rbis for qqq or i could add that year if you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get rbi home runs qqq the correlation between the lhs and the rhs is qqq which is significant at a ridiculously high level so i feel like the fit is good at the team level i ve no started to move on to the player level and have looked at qqq players will clark ozzie smith joe carter and don mattingly i hope to add quite a few more during my copious free time this year it does n t do too badly except the equation underpredicts the low hr hitter smith which may be a fault of the model or it could just be ozzie the results rbi hr years actual predicted carter qqq qqq qqq qqq clark qqq qqq qqq matt ly qqq qqq qqq qqq smith qqq qqq qqq qqq i think we can make a case and i hope to make it stronger that rbis can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up more later harold,0
note i m not posting this as part of an argument with roger meynard but as an independent sort of thread i do actually quote some things that roger meynard wrote but it might be better to think of this as sampling his post in the hip hop sense because it fits in with what i want to say there s an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people s conception of a biological organism in the biology context we would very likely read fitness for the score of the game and organisms for teams how we interpret players is trickier but either organs or genes might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make a genes interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case but that would be a different and probably longer post if however we take the organ view then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like species x is more fit than species y because of a better organ z given what we know about the interdependence of organs we would often be suspicious of such claims but note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map species x onto humans and organ z onto brain on the other hand some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others as far as we can test them e g brain above might be more reasonable than pancreas assuming no gross pathology particularly if species y is a primate even when you make such statements you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species however if we are non vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable whole but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable some of these processes might be localized to particular organs while others may be distributed across multiple organs in a way this is just like a baseball team except that i think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are much simpler and less numerous than in most organisms one thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do but of course this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research in this cases we re seeing the word statistics means summary of observed events where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process and possibly inputs for other processes thus if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses this statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment you might be fit in one situation and not another moving to baseball it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league in at least a nominal sense the division winners are the fittest teams in the league in that they on average had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts but in a real sense there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to or interesting for baseball the same is true in biology but here is also no direct biological equivalent of the world series in basebal in the world series the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful it might be fun to watch but it s unclear what it all really means now just one more un related point on the other hand you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes and maybe some of us e g me who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis but this is probably only due to the fact that a qqq schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops are n t the only difference between the winners and the losers moreover you ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the world series situation that makes the strong claim that nobody can predict the ws winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well known home vs road effect on winning percentage since stats are summaries of events it s true that if you know the events you can derive the stats but if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats then the stats produce new knowledge and some of this might even be reliable repeatable and useful speaking of which i should get back to producing knowledge in a different field that is of course if i can produce knowledge even though i m relying on stats to do it .,0

of course penalties will have to be changed roughing chauvanistic males being aggressive slashing chauvanistic males venting frustration fighting proof that males can not cope with their feelings no no no since all the penalties fall into three classes there should only be three penalties qqq foul any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your body or stick if you get qqq you are out for the game qqq unsportsmanlike contact an intentional foul this inlcludes all the current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding if you get two you are thrown out of the game and fined qqq technical foul bad mouthing the ref by player or coach penalty shot is awarded two and you are thrown out of the game besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets qqq penalties in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one until the end of the period the victim gets two shots if he she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured this works well for several reasons first penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey right so it follows that the more the better next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can take a commercial finally with only three penalties the network announcers don meredith dick vitale john madden pat summerall and marv levy among others will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the pa announcer says it oh one other rule when a goal is scored qqq qqq times a period the play can not resume until the pa announcer announces it this way the network can sneak in a few more commercials then once the pa announcer has told them who scored the tv announcer can tell you the viewer and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right seriously though i actually went to see a nba basketball game last week for the first time in my life i was amazed how boring it was the play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free throw shooting contests during the period of course the laker girls get to do their routines at least qqq qqq times during the game and not just between periods either there is a whistle every qqq seconds on average maybe less the game is qqq minutes with qqq minutes between quarters qqq qqq and qqq qqq and a qqq minute halftime and it still takes over qqq hours the reason for this has to be tv there is plenty of room to throw in commercials and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening on tv basketball is fairly entertaining imho but it is better to watch it on tv than to be there if this is the road the nhl is following then it truly is a sad day enough for now .,1

i tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues the braves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis as they had little talent on their roster for some time steve avery for example was rushed to the majors and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign his subsequent pitching has not been affected by his qqq era during his rookie year bill james pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound bob horner was also rushed to the majors out of arizona state directly had good numbers immediately i am not certain of the ages of people like pete smith craig mcmurty and derek lilliquist the braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed lilliquist and smith struggled but it did n t hurt ps and dl may have been overhyped i seem to recall cm pitching well initially though i do n t have stats handy .,0

most of the points you made about lopez v berryhill olson have been made by others and realizing that lopez must be the second coming of frank thomas i have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of his supporters see this is essentially what everyone was doing comparing lopez to one of the best players in the game i m really looking forward to seeing this can t miss superstar now as for thomas i remember being an advocate of his being brought up in qqq even though he was only qqq or qqq ca n t remember but who did the sox have at first calderon martinez kittle the spot was there the talent was there sure i say go for it i am not convinced that lopez is anywhere near as talented as thomas was after his aa season in qqq and i am not convinced that olson berryhill are nearly as bad as kittle martinez were btw i do n t think thomas was hurt by those three months well if we ca n t compare our guy to one of the best in the game let s compare our decision to one of the most boneshead right cal eldred was qqq when he came up with a full season at aaa and a longer minor league career frankly i do n t know why he did n t make the club in qqq bones is a year younger with a lousy prior history and just watching him makes me think that i missed a career as a big league pitcher no one i repeat no one laughed louder than i did at the sheffield trade though i guess mieske has a future i take it back mcilvaine may have laughed louder aw gee shucks thanks guy except i missed the part where sdcn s admit they re wrong the beastmaster,0

you are absolutely correct braves fans are nothing but a bunch of bandwagoners correct me if i am wrong but qqq or qqq years ago you could nt give away a ticket to see the braves play i would bet my next paycheck that qqq of the so called braves fans living outside of georgia at the present time can not name more than qqq players from their qqq season on the other hand ask any cubs fan living anywhere in the united states to name qqq players from any given year and qqq of them probably could granted the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park but that does not mean they diserve the title america s team the only reason they are considered america s team is because of ted turner and his little tv station which broadcasts across the nation i ll consider toronto america s team before the braves go reds !,0

cool and thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly name calling of others one of the basic things you need to ok actually i think the large scale sample size is part of the problem it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to ba vs clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of bell curve the x axis being the deviation in clutch hitting vs non clutch the y axis being the number of players certainly there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell my supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players as opposed to all baseball players as a counterexample to you wo n t hear those kind of accusations from me it is interesting that you selected maldonado because he is someone whom i have also looked at he has been a very inconsistent hitter in terms of ba hitting in qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq admittedly he has been traded between leagues as well as clubs his clutch hitting record is equally inconsistent so for my purposes in qqq i would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior performance i do n t know how i would have felt in qqq but you may indeed be right when i looked at sabo i found a more consistent record of hitting and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his non clutch ba ditto for joe carter this probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement i am having with others on this topic must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity is it impossible or irrational to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base i completely accept that reasoning again what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis amen the beastmaster,0

was the abc coverage of the kings flames game supposed to be the way it was shown in bc with cbc overriding the abc coverage when i flipped to abc it was the same commentators same commercials even my question is was this the real abc coverage or did cbc just black out the abc coverage for its own comment cbc had a great chance for some double headers toronto detroit and vancouver winnipeg but today they said that the east gets the leafs and the west get the vancouver game i thought that they would show them both .,1

gretzky lemieux gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman they play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one if they were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive abilities when you compare gretzky et al to jarvis gainey etc you are comparing apples and oranges it is like me telling you that felix potvin is n t very good because a team would be better if the had lemieux instead of him sure lemieux is a better player but he is a different type of player for a team to be successful they need to have all types of players this includes defensive forwards when compared with other defensive forwards bob gainey is the greatest defensive forward ever he is the player who s talents best suited being a defensive forward who completely dominated the game when he played maybe if a more talented player such as gretzky had decided to waste his offensive talents and play defensively he could have been a better defensive forward but he was n t bob gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey .,1

here s a summary of don cherry s coach s corner from april qqq qqq it was taken from a tape delay of a vancouver winnipeg game but it was filmed during the toronto detroit game that night i think it was also shown during the calgary la game warning anti fighting people may want to skip this post topics don s tie doug gilmour wings leafs quebec montreal boston buffalo wendel clark fighting and stickwork episode summary once again the episode started with a shot of don s tie this was a different tie than last time don pointed out some of the characters on the tie but gave them different names felix the cat sylverster maclean daffy duck etc ron maclean asked don what he thought of the current wings leafs game don thought it was good burns told the leaf players they won in their building we re going to win in ours don then began to praise gilmour again don pointed out that gilmour has never got less than qqq points or a goal in any game since he got qqq points in a game against st louis don also claims that he gave a lot of encouragement to gilmour which was partly responsible for his good play several clips were then shown of gilmour from the series a hit on constantinov and a pass to andrewchuk resulting in a goal on the game itself the wings were taking a lot of penalties in the first period the wings have enough talent to score short handed however and when the leafs get a power play coach burns tells the leaf players do n t let them score on you ron brought up the previous quebec montreal game note montreal won that game in overtime despite having a possible game winner disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick don thought the high stick was obvious even without the use of instant replay on the buffalo boston series note buffalo is currently winning the series qqq qqq don gave full credit to goaltender grant fuhr fuhr should be getting qqq the team s playoff checks for his play wendel clarke has recently been criticized for his performance during the detroit toronto series don defended him by saying that he ca n t play the way he should because of the league s new rules this used to be a rough and tough league now its all hack and slash don lays the blame on gil stien for the problems don s opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by wings gm and coach bryan murray a clip from a news conference by murray was shown in which murray made statements claiming the elimination of fighting increases stickwork don also read a newspaper article in which murray makes the following statements players do n t fight because they re afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator instead they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing each other is this what the fans want to see i guarantee there would n t be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game don warned league commisioner gary bettman to smarten up with fighting in hockey he went on to say that before there used to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series now with no fights someone gets cut every period rating typical anti fighting posturing but here don s opinion is supported by murray .,1
i dunno about hat i have friends up there on genie who are now saying that ottawa s gone soft on daigle and is thinking hard about pronger daigle has shown an attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne t liked and after coming back from his second multi game suspension for being stupid he s really tanked in his performance his stock is dropping like a rock also remember that a lot of teh draft qqq stuff comes from the assumption he ll be traded to quebec for lots of prospects it s not clear that quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current status he s still first round but i do n t consider him a first pick lock by any means at this point it s also possible that the senators are posturing to try to bring down his signing price since daigle has been taking some lindros lessons during thos suspensions no kariya wo n t go in the first three for a very simple reason he s not leaving college and i do n t believe any of the expansion teams are going to use a first for someone who wo n t be around for another year or two not when there is equally good or almost as good stuff available that can make an immediate impact san jose seems to be leaning heavily towards niedermayer for that reason kariya could go qqq or qqq unless a team can convince him to leave school early which i doubt my cut on things as they stand today it depends on if the sharks can get a deal for him i do n t believe they draft him to keep him .,1

i have been to all qqq isles caps tilts at the crap centre this year all isles wins and there is no justification for vukota and pilon to play for the isles vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world he could n t hit a bull in the ass with a banjo al must remember a few years back when mick scored qqq goals in one period against the caps in a qqq qqq isles win i was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd wake up al years later he s gotten worse he s a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupid senseless penalties i think he would make a good police officier as for pilon he ca n t carry the puck out to center ice by himself he either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover or he attempts to bring the puck towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater he ca n t stay on his skates with most forwards or centers he either falls down or committs a penalty call up somebody from capital district al as far as the playoffs the isles are as difficult to figure out as the caps two good teams with talent but so inconsistent they should meet in the first round the isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they should play well against jersey tonite it ll probably be another tight qqq game as the last qqq games hve been for the isles i wish when the get a lead they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive shell and letting the opposition get back in the game al must understand he ca n t do with this team what he did with the qqq qqq isles maybe al should got to where is bobby nystrom clark gilles john tonelli these are the kind of young minds we need behing the bench fire al john scialdone scialdone nssdca gsfc nasa gov,1

lots of debate about the virtues of bryan murray vs pat quinn as a gm deleted randy graca seems to think murray is the best gm in the league i think quinn is one of several who are better when quinn took over vancouver several years ago not last year they regularily missed the playoffs i ca n t recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably did quinn has improved the team from non playoff calibre to a serious contender when murray took over in detroit the were about a qqq team that was a contender to win the norris division and possibly even a stanley cup contender so quinn has improved his team more than murray has since taking over as a gm quinn is one example of a better gm than murray .,1

speaking of spelling errors on the cup i wonder if the h in pittsburgh made it to the cup you know how funny people can be about spelling pittsburgh .,1
the goalie to whom you refer is clint malarchuk he was at that time playing with the sabres his team immediately prior to that was the washington capitals while he did recover and continue to play i do not know his present whereabouts .,1
i ca n t believe that the ny rangers would force its players to go to binghamtom to play in the ahl playoffs instead of letting them represent their countries in the world championships anderrson and zubov are waiting for the nhl to make a decision to this while kovalev has given in and gone down to the minors the rangers are a disgrace ps it has been reported that neil smith was very much against the hiring of mike keenan how long will smith be in ny for ?,1
well i do n t want shorter games per se but i would like for them to stop wasting so much time during games the gant incident is a perfect example when a guy comes to the plate he should be up there to hit not show off or show up the umpire which is clearly what gant was doing i feel like writing a fan letter to hirschbeck mike jones aix high end development mjones donald aix kingston ibm com,0

okay i think we all agree that singles hitters should take a strike or two and try to get on base any way they can so the no power impatient guys have no excuse the no power patient guys are doing the right thing now the impatient power guys how could you leave out the big cat would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took more pitches perhaps but i doubt it if you tell joe carter to go up there and take a few pitches he will draw more walks but he also wo n t hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive the patient power guys joe morgan had a small strike zone and rickey henderson has a strike zone the size of hitler s heart so they get their walks based on the small zone look at the other qqq guys thomas bonds mcgwire ruth and williams wow a lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them the pitchers would do better in my opinion by just coming after them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch but pitchers would rather nibble go qqq qqq or qqq qqq and then get hurt .,0
add mike trombley in there somewhere since they need five people mark guthrie will remain in the bullpen as the long lefty pags and terry jorgenson will platoon at third with reboulet as the backup infielder pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who lead the league in da in qqq muffing what should be routine grounders heck muffing a grounder i would probably have gotten to jorgenson did nothing exceptional that i noticed leius missed a ball i think gagne would have reached we will certainly miss gag s glove this season he looked pretty good there contrary to what the mediots have been saying he looked reasonable at first he is n t qqq hrbek but then neither is the pretty big guy himself any more note i m used to seeing the twins qqq looking kinda big on the field but not that big if he hits vaguely like last year he s a perfectly good first baseman note much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings winfield may have big holes in his defensive game that did n t show up he did n t have to pick any bad throws for example but i ll take what i saw so far .,0
his performance at the plate may well be from the shoulder injury received when he ran into the wall making a catch in the cincy series it may also be him pressing a little as for the baserunning it does not appear to be just lankford dent made the bad call sending lankford in the sunday night game against cincy but everyone had a bad time against the dodger s catcher good question at least it does n t appear that we are seeing the same zeile ),0

how many runs will be scored in denver i do n t know but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in mile high stadium during the last few years of the bears zephyrs tenure in the american association here s the total runs scored per game in zephyrs games all league games and the ratio i found the same ratios for hr year rpg lea ratio hrpg lea ratio qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq qqq it seems pretty clear that denver will have a large effect on runs scored i ll stick with my prediction from last year that it ll be one of the top qqq in the nl this year and a fairly large effect on homeruns though apparently not as large as atlanta wrigley cincinnati and san diego still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park .,0

with the kind of team montreal has now they can take the cup easily the only problem they have right now is that everyone is trying to steal the show and play alone they need some massive teamwork they are also in a little of a slump because long time hockey montreal canadiens announcer claude mouton died last tuesday and it was rough on everybody because he has worked with the organization for qqq years but i know that is no excuse but if the habs manage to get some good teamwork and get into the spirit they should have no problem winning in may .,1
i m confused how is it hal mcrae s fault that he ca n t win with a team whose best offensive player is phil hiatt i mean let s be real kansas city will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end up near qqq they have less offense than any other team in baseball even if you count the expansion teams .,0
"you should be ashamed to call yourself an ulf samuelson fan anybody who plays the way he does does not belong in the nhl there have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game but a lot of them have been talanted players bobby clarke kenny linsemen pie mckenzie chris chelios etc but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as ulf violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like should have been a women samuelson do n t belong when players like ulf who s main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue and the league wo n t stop it the players should a christian pro qqq aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely if the bruins get a chance to meet pittsburgh in the near future you can bet neely will have his day the sight of watching ulf turtle up like the coward he is is worth almost as much as a stanely cup this wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game if you are to remove ulf samuelson from the lineup the penguins would not even notice he s gone he s an eyesore on the game of hockey rich thank you for your extremely lucid and well thought out observation now when you get back on your medication please let us know how you are feeling thank you ,",1

note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various sc and prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local nhl owners when if cablevision vp chuck dolan s purchase of the islanders goes through the islanders will be back solidly in the scny fold their original owners were and they ve remained due to a lucrative tv contract the flyer snyders own the philadelphia sc as well as the prism pay channel there are six teams affiliated with regional sc s another half dozen affiliated with prime outlets and other locals like hts and nesn who have barter arrangements with all this cross ownership i was surprised that espn got the deal this season gld,1
that brings up an interesting point anyone else catch espn s piece about prospects and the relationship between age career length mvps and hall of fame members it was part of their preseason special basically they looked at players that had amassed qqq plate appearances or abs by the time they were qqq and noticed some interesting things for starters they found out such players comprised the majority of mvps in the history of the game they also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame the kicker though was that they actually did some number crunching and found that such players careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group they also found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals hrs etc of the other players the first group outhit the second something like qqq to qqq in raw ba and blew away the second group in such categories as hrs qqq rbis etc it was the most impressive thing i ve seen on espn in recent memory i guess ray knight makes his rebuttal tonight .,0

i loved the abc coverage the production was excellent the appearance was excellent it had a sleek modern look this was the first time i heard thorne clement i thought they were great my only request is to leave al micheals out of this he annoys me i was skeptical before the game but was pleasantly surprised at the coverage i was particularly impressed by the close range camera coverage of work in the corners and behind the play without losing a beat getting back to the puck boy everyone has been ripping on espn s hockey coverage or is it just pittsburgher s who are thrilled with lange steigy for all of you who are unaware espn bought the air time from abc and did all the production advertising sales commentating etc and even reaped any made .,1

well had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of your predictions the responses would probably have been a bit more measured be that as it may clemens is always in this form and viola is n t really performing beyond what might reasonably have been expected how do you know that the sox are responding to them and not to al bumbry hobson or my most likely suspect new hitting coach mike easler i certainly am more likely to give easler credit for mo vaughhn s hot start than clemens or viola this was the optimistic scenario but not unreasonably so he has n t shown much power yet though how can you tell that dawson is providing the leadership perhaps it s calderon perhaps it s clemens and viola maybe hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him or maybe it s all a myth and dawson has been hitting reasonably well but not as well as greenwell vaughn cooper or fletcher in three games why do n t we look at this one again in say july a bit better than could reasonably have been expected but do n t forget that zupcic looked like wade boggs lite for about qqq ab s last year beware of small sample sizes still if fletcher hits as well as he did last year he d be a great improvement over any sox leadoff hitter from last year be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he does n t have to make more than qqq ab or so in a year ummm sorry no i can buy the in the field part and i think he ll be better at the plate than the qqq boggs but in general cooper while he ll be a pretty good hitter could n t carry boggs jockstrap with a little luck he could be the fourth or fifth best qqq in the al martinez boggs ventura and palmer will all be better see here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether qqq is plausible third is not unlikely but phrases like could run away with the division are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats it s not really clear that their staff is better than last year if russell does well darwin does n t go on the dl and hesketh does n t pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation they could be better on the other hand if hesketh pitches miserably and they re too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up conroy or somebody fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he s a lefty and russell explodes they could be pretty bad mike jones aix high end development mjones donald aix kingston ibm com,0
mr hernandez ñ i apologize for the misunderstanding i explained that i know that it is essential for some fans to get scores here for they can not get them elsewhere i have no problem with what you do posting scores after the games have been completed however like i said earlier i do n t think it is a necessity to post scores during the middle of games like some others have come to practice .,0
only appreciated paul coffey of detroit redwings,1
do n t worry this is a perfectly normal state of affairs had they actually been using him you should be worried he s recovered totally from his injury that s why he s not pitching so he can rest his arm enough that he can get injured again pitching on qqq days rest and then have fun dining in the diamond club in shea stadium while ay struggles every day out there i ve be quite happy to drop john franco just the same bring back randy myers no better make that bring back neil allen !,0
qqq qqq organization eskimo north qqq qqq qqq eskimo com yeah morris just knows how to win that s why he lost qqq for detroit in qqq funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but loses a lot when he pitches on bad ones and if rings was the only criteria for success then teams would always tend to repeat and eventually you d have the same team win the ws every bleepin year sort of like the yanks in the qqq morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good not great career toronto will finish qqq or qqq this year with morris and all those rings because their pitching staff was destroyed over the off season .,0
can anybody name a player who was rushed to the majors let s for argument s sake define rushed as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age qqq or younger and performing below expectations whose career was damaged by this rushing i m serious i tend to agree with david that bringing the player up sooner is better but i d like to look at players for whom this theory did n t work if there are any i d prefer players within the last qqq years or so because then i can look up their minor league stats it s important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected as opposed to players who were hyped and failed but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers let s kick it off with an example of a player who was rushed although there does n t seem to have been any damage to his career jay bell was given qqq pas in the major leagues at age qqq and performed well below what you would expect from his aaa numbers the same season he got qqq pas the next year at age qqq and still underperformed however the next year at age qqq his performance improved and he won the everyday shortstop job and has been there ever since it s really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league where he was performed quite well in aaa during this time rather than being rushed cleveland might have been better off i suppose because they might have been less likely to give up on him yes if you bring a player up early he s likely going to struggle but does that delay the time at which he stops struggling and starts performing up to expectations ?,0
pray for the wings to become lazy and overconfident the wings can only lose the series toronto can not win it take away doug gilmour and the leafs are an old tampa bay the leafs deserve a lot of credit for their diligent effort during the regular season but if detroit puts in a reasonable effort this is not a contest .,1
well yeah on the other hand for the first few years of his career he looked like herb washington dan gladden does n t seem to suck defensively either yeah and how many of the white guys played one year into a long career it s actually not an uncommon phenomenon and how long a guy hangs around based on one good year seems like a reasonable question to explore on a racial basis hey he plays for lou gorman does n t he ok so it s eight years good point on cedeno otoh i have n t seen that extensive list of qqq dan gladdens either there really are n t that many players altogether who hang around for qqq years even if they re reasonably good mike jones aix high end development mjones donald aix kingston ibm com,0
no caleb it s not the quality of espn that i have a problem with it is superb whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where espn left off when hockey went to sc this is excepting sc s use of feeds from cbc it s the amount of hockey they re showing or lack of it that we re complaining about they had rights to two ot s that could ve been shown on sunday night after baseball and they had pickup trucks racing through oversized pigpens followed by qqq home movies of old car races yes i was checking in desperation for canucks jets last night after sportscenter gld,1

oops i came across this file from last year thought you might enjoy some of these thoughts the predictions were made on the date indicated they are largely out of order june qqq qqq tedward cs cornell edu me you all know how things turned out the orioles red sox and yankees all disappeared the jays and tigers continued at essentially the expected pace the brewers and indians cranked in the second half the rangers predictably took a dive that should n t have surprised anybody meanwhile as predicted the mariners dropped behind the angels and royals they clearly did n t deserve the qqq qqq record in june the white sox and a s upped their game a bit while the twins dropped off a little but for the most part things were as expected okay so there were a few blatant errors but for a predictive calculation i thought this did pretty well from cavgeoe yalevm ycc yale edu tue mar qqq qqq qqq hm pete smith made the rotation instead of mercker and bielecki was n t released until the end of the year i wo n t comment on the bullpen jeff reardon right on blauser wrong on bream and mitchell a bit early on lonnie as with bielecki did n t pick sanders did anybody three of them went right showalter is still around and likely to stick it seems from mattel auto trol com mattel auto trol com tue mar qqq qqq qqq nope they won the division and so kept him for a shot at the playoffs well they did n t finish last got that one right nope i guess this is why you picked the mets to win huh tsk tsk not nice to predict something like this you got that right and my response okay so the mets finished fifth but i got the pirates and expos right first half dead on second half ummm i m a sox fan go easy on me so i got my predictions for gooden and saberhagen reversed i was at least close and was right about jefferies though i do n t know has wfan criticized the jefferies trade close no cigar some predictions need no introduction sometimes us statheads get lucky grace did n t hit behind dawson the entire season but he also finished with only qqq rbis nope he slowed down and the injury finished him off did n t even reach qqq but a ballsy prediction nonetheless from ecaxron mars lerc nasa gov thu may qqq qqq qqq the orioles finished seven games out none of them won qqq though mussina might have had a chance with better relief and more starts except for the brewers who you probably forgot you were right the rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre the yankees and indians led with qqq wins the red sox trailed with qqq wins none were horrible but four were five or more games below qqq from djohnson cayley uwaterloo ca david johnson date thu qqq aug qqq qqq gmt you win from king cogsci ucsd edu thu nov qqq qqq qqq you were right from stvjas meteor wisc edu fri sep qqq qqq qqq he had qqq ip but did n t win the cy young maddux surprised all i do n t think i want to wait that long but they won qqq games last year and they were fifth in the league in era not a bad start looks like it he was n t bad last year just too consistent to be an ace so far this year looks like more of the same i honestly ca n t say did they get rid of him their bb totals were down last year i just do n t think he s that good so far so good i m definitely not waiting to check this one from qqq fri sep qqq qqq qqq current plans seem to be to use quantrill in long relief he has a rubber arm and unusual delivery he might be decent in that role from lyle ecn purdue edu sat sep qqq qqq qqq wrong on all of the above hal morris and my favorites from tedward sun oct qqq qqq qqq belle hit qqq hr last year walking qqq times but five of those were intentional okay so i exaggerate but i might have been right from trn strdev jhuapl edu tue mar qqq qqq qqq how much did cal sign for when did he sign if i remember correctly he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak season and finally from jpalmer uwovax uwo ca thu sep qqq qqq qqq snyder is still in sf acker is gone they are n t in the majors never heard of him i do n t think they are in the majors dunno what happened to him if he s still around he s stuck in the minors hm with raines out bo looks to get a lot of pt hm -,0
yah so he certainly did n t earn his last one how many games did he blow in the world series all of the ones he started oh yes definitely therefore morris is better than clemens do n t give me that shit if boston had alomar olerud henke and ward while toronto had rivera jack clark jeff reardon things would have looked a little different last fall give credit where credit is due this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick i m willing to bet they do n t finish sixth i m also willing to bet they do n t finish first and if you give me qqq qqq odds i m willing to bet that they finish ahead of the blue jays .,0
is there any doubt that this is true after a few down years the a l east is back to where it was in the early eighties with the emergence of the o s and the yanks it is far and away the best while the n l west has the best team in baseball and the reds are n t bad either they have nothing else the giants astros and padres all have talent they do not have the all arounf teams that are found in the a l east and the dodgers just plain suck as for the rockies who knows the a l east has the defending champs and although they lost a lot to free agency toronto is still one of the best in baseball the orioles have the preseason favorite to win the cy young in mike mussina and you can never forget about ripken the signings of harold baines and harold reynolds do n t hurt to much either although i always liked bill ripken while they let a lot go this summer randy milligan joe orsulak bill ripken bob milacki sam horn storm davis and craig lefferts they kept the heart of their team intact my predicted finish qqq baltimore could be a biased opinion qqq ny yankees qqq toronto qqq milwaukee qqq detroit qqq boston qqq cleveland would have been higher if not for the accident go o s !,0
is it just me or does bichette look totally lost in the outfield he misplayed martinez fly out into a double against the expos misplayed alou s single into a triple alou tagged out at qqq after over sliding the bag and now he misplays another out into a qqq run triple add in his wonderful batting average and we have one heck of a player !,0
i only have one comment on this you call this a classic playoff year and yet you do n t include a chicago detroit series c mon i m a boston fan and i even realize that chicago detroit games are the most exciting games to watch .,1

are most players who come up young always good when they re young or later damn i was afraid you would say that well perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be lopez in there but they do have others worth playing at least in their opinion and i happen to agree i can believe that i m a newbie here so i ll take your word but alomar is a fine defensive catcher which was my statement above that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age as long as they feel he can also hit a bit lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded seasoning sorry new do n t know nichols law do n t believe in catchers era but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers any info on that in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial i presume we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta no well if it does make organizational sense one can hardly fault them for their decisions i mean please do n t tell me how to run my business especially when i m being successful i m sure you could be right you could also be smoking some illegal substance hey that s a joke do n t get offended please well i ca n t cite anyone s ethical rectitude because i do n t know what it means but again if it makes organizational sense then so be it baseball is a business and if there is a solid business reason for keeping lopez on the farm then that s what the braves should do i happen to believe that it s a baseball decision while you from your armchair may disagee i do n t i think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made i predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training i think it is a very normal decision to have made it is certainly more reversible than to have started lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers sure it may be conservative it may also be logical i do n t know what ethics have to do with it seems like pretty good common sense to me the beastmaster,0

frankly no offense and defense are equally important but the pitcher is qqq of the defense the primary role of every other player is on offense even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive game than of the defensive game they might not do much with their part of the offense but that s another issue that being said i think both smith and yount deserve the hof they hit pretty well in addition to their defense .,0
if i remember correctly which is always in doubt horner s signing with the braves was contingent on starting in atlanta i think he could have gone back to arizona st for one more year if he had n t signed anyhow the braves did try to send him to richmond once it lead to a week long walkout methinks horner had no work ethic before he was drafted and minor league play would n t have helped but his raw talent would have gotten him into the ml and it did keep him there for a while until he started falling on his wrists .,0
i heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in edmonton oiler owner peter pocklington will be holding a press conference next week while the exact details are not known it is believed to concern the oiler s future rumour has it that pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with copps collesium in hamilton during the press conference pocklington may announce the deal it is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northlands to renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium northlands has offered to buy the oilers for qqq million earlier but the offer was rejected immediately by pocklington .,1
well i got ta tell ya last night s leafs game vs the devils was a nail bitter let me tell you it was a well played game by both teams i thought but according to the don and ron it was the an off night for the leafs and the devils were outplaying toronto well i beg to differ imho clark deserved to be a first star as much as gilmour did his fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the clark of old but not to take any of the credit away from gilmour i think the leafs are playing great hockey why well first look at their injury list which includes cullen ellet zezel macoun of course my question is this how will the leafs fare when they are once again healthy if they are playing this well so far second just look at their standings still second in defence moved from qqq overall to qqq over in the last month have n t lost at home in last qqq games qqq game undefeated streak etc btw am i wrong or was this potvin s first shut out i ca n t remember him having any as of yet well as of april qqq we see that the race for first in the norris has truly begun and it will be a very close race between chicago and toronto and the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one coming to the stretch and still a roar in go leafs go !,1

why did i get sucked into this assuming you re serious i guess you d be surprised to hear that us guys do n t think so i would guess that a tiny fraction of qqq of the folks reading your post agree with it i kind of doubt that even you agree with it i m not going to go through your points one at a time because after all not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball i m only replying to this because you brought up pam postema the aaa umpire who sued is suing baseball on the grounds of sex discrimination because she was n t promoted to the majors i ve never seen her ump a game i have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire but i have seen her on talk shows and her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most it seems to me that she is missing the point and if that s how she sees the role of umpires in the game well i would n t promote her either the umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out hell joe lundy could do that their primary function is to maintain order in the game keep the game moving and keep the players from trying to kill each other umpires have to be extremely tough people that disqualifies most of us both men and women and if ms postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook then i think that disqualifies her as well umpires need to command the game command of the rulebook is secondary .,0
we re probably stuck as mike burger pointed out that the baseball deal was made far in advance of the nhl contract wabc did the same thing they were thankful that the devils were wiped out by qqq because they had to switch over to yankees baseball the proof of the reasons for this is left to the reader it s too bad but i wonder if espn is stuck with other us local team coverage for their alternate games we got nesn s coverage of the bruins sabres with the boston homers they were awful i ve read that derek sanderson is the colour analyst i wonder if he spent his early years after hockey as an intern at pravda before landing this job everything had to be twisted into something good to say about the bruin s involved not even bill wirtz s shills on sc chicago pat foley dale tallon were this bad and just to be fair sc used to take their feed from esn empire sports network the sabre homers and they were horrible too but they were spacy from the cnn highlights i hear chris cuthbert s voice from the cbc coverage of the habs nords series too bad that we could n t get it on espn with all due respect to the sabres and the bruins mike emrick is substituting on the devils scny team for gary thorne mike was the original devils tv play by play announcer by the way gld,1

the phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings last night s game was hard fought the game in chicago should have been a blow out all in all these two games show a different phillies team in past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of qqq run games i do n t know how many times i saw them losing by only qqq run if they were able to win most of those they might have been more of a contending team they are qqq qqq so far in extra innings and of course they are qqq qqq .,0
dummy hoy a late qqq century baseball player was deaf in order for him to be able to find out whether the pitch was a ball or strike the umpires developed hand signals this also helped to relieve the stress on umpires vocal cords so they did n t have to shout strike or ball qqq times a game heard about this one from the only worthwhile baseball book john thorn has ever authored a century of baseball lore ),0
gee you d think winnipeg would be tops on that list what with qqq regulars being european well being a jet fan i sometimes wish that bure would get knocked silly too nothing serious just enough to keep him out of a game in most cases the owners have very little to do with it they give their general managers one order when it comes to the draft find me the best players so that our team will win the stanley cup whether that player is in kindersley saskatchewan or chelyabinsk russia if the gm believes him to be the better player the gm should be drafting him where do you get off calling the nhl their league when referring to canadian players it does n t belong to them it belongs to the owners the owners can do what they want while a canadian content rule might be enforcable here in canada there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the us that the cfl sorry for the football reference did n t even try to push their import ratio rule on the sacromento goldminers increasing the competition for the elite positions in most cases would make players better anyways oh yeah and how many europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in north america while there are some that play in the ahl or the ihl where that s an nhl team s primary farm club you do n t hear of many europeans playing in the chl the echl or on the secondary farm teams in the ihl ie the jets do have a few russian players in moncton but i do n t believe there are any europeans in ft wayne so with all those teams there are plenty of positions for hockey players in north america i m in favour of the nhl being the league for the premier players in the world i ve grown up with europeans playing on my team and some of those players were the among the best in the world from hedberg nilsson and sjoberg to sel nne zhamnov and olausson and all those in between and to come i would n t have it any other way .,1
i remember reading an article in reader s digest many moons ago about a similar incident during a minor leaque game a player neck was cut when the opponent he was back checking tripped and his skakes flew up in this case the victim s mask proved a hinderance since his face was protected and so he did n t bother with the usually instinctive reaction to protect his face neck a quick thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using snow to contract the blood vessels from what i can remember .,1
do n t expect to get top quality just some toughness i do n t view makarov as a player who would add toughness nelson you re confusing skill and toughness hey get off the mcgill hammond thing i m no fan of either my point is that last year the sharks had toughness that was missing this year this year we had more skill i m all for that but if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they ca n t do you much good whether it s a cheap shot or not you ca n t let the other teams push you around the qqq qqq sharks simply got pushed around to much other teams knew this they knew they could aggressively check the sharks and not pay for it adding some players in the off season who will add some toughness to the team will help insure that next season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously check our skill players or to take cheap shots it does n t guarantee no injuries nothing does but it s something the sharks can do to reduce the number of injuries mark just say,1

according to the recent tsn report peter puck is not paying any interest on the treasury branch loans that s a lot of green again according to tsn virtually everything that peter puck has already has liens against it of course we ca n t really be sure of this the oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is that a deal is a deal sather has spouted this repeatedly pocklinton has a contract with northlands until qqq a deal is a deal perhaps if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets players such as gretzky and the income he has received in expansion fees with his revenues he would n t be losing money he has admitted pulling this money out of the oiler franchise to put into his other businesses i think that pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization i ca n t really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but he is certainly not entitled to it pocklington has sucked revenue out of the oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests pocklington is not to be trusted i doubt very much that any oiler team will ever again make the playoffs under pocklington s stewardship as soon as a player shows himself to be a competent nhl er and expects to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or draft picks -,1
hindsight s qqq qqq nobody expected kisio to have his qqq best career year i did n t mean to imply that gund s offer was n t enough gund s offer was the right but too late in the season qqq m offered in november lets sather buy a replacement for murphy this season and make the playoffs this year qqq m in march does n t help sather with his immediate objectives does n t help with long term objectives only a prospect or draft pick does and no way should the sharks do that however getting back to what if games had kisio been traded to chicago last year then the sharks go qqq for october and maybe gund panicks sooner in november and here s another what if twist chicago would have had kisio this season they never go after murphy in the first place because kelly is having his best season bigger guys in chicago so gund has no competition so ferriera sather and keenan all look like geniuses a broken fax machine and ferriera keenan and maybe kingston and maybe even green lose their jobs kind of makes you shiver does n t it bottomline for every black scenario any of you can concoct for kisio leaving i can concoct an equally bright one are you serious let ferierra go fire kingston these last two basically mean that sharks are starting over again in terms of the timetable to capture the cup as i ve stated frequently qqq out qqq expansion teams had the same gm from inception through cup season broadcast more home games than away games broadcast very few road pacific and mountain time games jack up my ticket prices from qqq to qqq in two years not that i m going to pay qqq bucks for qqq seats i ll probably next to the virtual qqq folks not tell me my priority not let me sell my priority in order for me to get the free jacket force me to order my tickets for next season before i get to select my section not let me park at the new arena after paying for their privileged parking lot which was sometimes full when i got there for qqq straight years i ve been a loyal ticket holder since day qqq literally in spring of qqq when the team was announced and i m not getting that loyalty returned wirtz treats his fans far better by comparison and pocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all i know one is n t suppose to make negative comments on signatures but what did us oiler fans do to you to deserve the stay in edmonton part i d never wish the kings to leave metro la it s too much fun watching the shark s beat them .,1

as the sharks season came to a close tonight i will start a series of posts trying to revisit the players the trades the moves etc that went through for the sharks for the past season if you are uninterested since i will have the words sharks review in the subject heading in these postings you can kill them i will first try to evaluate how the players did these ratings of course are subject to my own biases but i hope that i can try to be as objective as possible i will evalute players who finished the season with the sharks and or did not play for another nhl team this season thus then let s go to the goaltenders qqq brian hayward season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade p d it is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end a career that featured sharing three jennings trophies with patrick roy in qqq qqq and qqq it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade and skip the letter grading but he had simply been awful on ice this year save for a bright spot or two and even if he had been healthy he would not be any more than the qqq string goalie but hayward was a classy individual who also figured in on the sharks first ever victory the qqq game of the season last year against the calgary flames as he retires the fans will remember what a good guy he was qqq jeff hackett season qqq acquired qqq qqq from n y islanders in expansion draft grade c hackett after deservedly winning the team mvp honors last season simply wasted the year other than a few good spots qqq saves against los angeles almost shutout against tampa bay etc hackett finishing with qqq save percentage and a qqq gaa watched his status go from the team s qqq goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season he was expected early to carry the team along instead he apparently became frustrated but the an early injury that forced him to miss qqq games may have been a contributing factor but upon return he simply was n t up to the task he may not return next year qqq wade flaherty season qqq still eligible as rookie acquired qqq qqq signed as undrafted free agent grade i a it is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone thus the incomplete grade but yet in the one start that he did get against the calgary flames flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods he started the season poorly in kansas city but finished strong prompting the blades owner ron parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the ihl mvp honors the upcoming ihl playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the nhl last year he was a capable backup for arturs irbe in the throughout the season and in the turner cup playoffs picking up all star honors along with irbe now it s time for him to show that he can share the job with irbe next year because with prospects dan ryder trevor robins and scott cashman coming along if he does n t make it next year he may not ever qqq arturs irbe season qqq acquired qqq qqq from minnesota in dispersal draft grade b i may yet be overly critical of irbe in a year that he clearly established that he s a bona fide nhl goaltender perhaps a bona fide qqq goaltender he has provided most of the little highlight footage that the sharks team had getting the team s first ever shut out against the los angeles kings on december qqq he has been fearless in and out of the net aggressively playing the puck and making passes reminding people of a young ron hextall except of course the goonism yet he still needs to develop more consistency which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him but if the sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season irbe s the key as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game qqq times in qqq starts .,1

first i enjoyed reading your post second i disagree with the pen s weak spot being defense and goaltending for a couple of reasons barrasso has had a spectacular year no slow start consistently sharp gaa qqq and leads the league in wins tommy deserves the vezina given the lack of respect he commands though i doubt he will win it the other reason concerns the pens team defense they are hovering around qqq or qqq in the fewest goals allowed that is a big improvement for them and it indicates that they are playing better team defense we ll see it ll be fun .,1
i am sure some bashers of pens fans are pretty confused about the lack of any kind of posts about the recent pens massacre of the devils actually i am bit puzzled too and a bit relieved however i am going to put an end to non pittsburghers relief with a bit of praise for the pens man they are killing those devils worse than i thought jagr just showed you why he is much better than his regular season stats he is also a lot fo fun to watch in the playoffs bowman should let jagr have a lot of fun in the next couple of games since the pens are going to beat the pulp out of jersey anyway i was very disappointed not to see the islanders lose the final regular season game pens rule !,1

absolute nonsense the decision that was made was pocklington s he chose qqq mill over gretzky if gretzky was n t upset about not being able to win a cup in la then i submit that he was n t worth the qqq mill how do you know what he thinks or thought the only thought that i can see that you have revealed is your own you do n t like gretzky big deal the real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty what the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the ref wo n t be fooled i ca n t imagine why anyone would expect someone like lemieux to change his game why do n t you pick on qqq dimensional over rated type like hull and salami -,1
i guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series and in fact all year have been pretty much consistently correct remember the rule says it s a strike if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone i would certainly agree that high strikes are not called who could argue this point but all in all i think in and out is called pretty well .,0

o k it would be a shame for cards fans on the net to go through the qqq championship season without a mailing list to talk on so i would be willing to look at starting one except there s one little problem i do n t know the first thing about how to do it or what it requires in terms of resources or time so if some kind soul could e mail me the particulars of getting starting and managing a mail list i d see if it would be feasible for me to start a cards mailing list thanks in advance dick detweiler,0
foolish me and here i thought it had something to do with the fact that they were hitting against wakefield who had no kncukle to his ball that day and otto who has no stuff i wonder if reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the lineup who also suddenly came alive those two games the beastmaster,0
it was clint malarchuk whatever happened to him anyway ?,1
hey valentine i do n t see boston with any world series rings on their fingers damn morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his future therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing and do n t tell me boston will win this year they wo n t even be in the top qqq in the division more like qqq .,0
wiggins alan but that s besides the point i m sure people would feel slightly sympathetic for rickey if he were killed but they would also be criticizing him a lot more for his actions example how about jose canseco he gets a couple of speeding tickets and all of the sudden his attitude is awful what the hell do speeding tickets have to do with clubhouse influence anyway so why do sportswriters talk about it all the time or brian hunter and keith mitchell both of whom had dwi problems towards the end of last year two years ago it was cited as a sign of their immaturity etc meanwhile dykstra almost killed both himself and daulton and i did n t read any sportswriter complaining about that they may have talked about how bad it was for the phillies but i never read anywhere criticism of dykstra s character or daulton s intelligence for that matter based on this incident .,0
interesting one of our german friends here robert told me their forwards were all canadian germans perhaps somebody can sort this out for us ok this ai n t north america and so on but i still doubt that _ any _ city having a pop of qqq and below could support an nhl team of course switzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small distances between cities but still dusseldorf yes although the arena is an anachronism an open wall behind one of the goals essentially an outdoor arena cologne s arena only seats about qqq qqq berlin is about qqq and no new facility will be built unless their olympic bid is successful munich does have an arena malmo is big enough but they also need a new arena the current one has qqq seats i think if we re talking about the nhl even helsinki would struggle to make it work turku despite an excellent arena and tampere are nowhere near big enough for major league hockey rome and the south are out of the question this could as well be africa to hockey fans romans were given the chance to host some qqq games but showed no interest whatsoever all teams in the italian league come from milan and the smaller cities in the north paris had their own volans francais sp pro team a couple of years ago i believe they even made it to the european club championship finals tournament one year but eventually folded due to lower than hoped for attendances the remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor sport like hockey the easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey perhaps most european teams will have to be like the tampa bay lightning anyway playing in a small qqq seat arena backed by japanese money run by enthusiasts phil esposito heavy marketing fans that have difficulty telling what icing means london has been mentioned sheffield and birmingham also have large arenas and a new mega facility qqq seats might be built in bristol in a couple of years no facilities to speak of their biggest arena in eindhoven seats qqq fans for hockey .,1
and while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded resigned or been striped of his title during the season any other team captain trivia would be appreciated luc robitaille was captain of the kings the first third of the season until the great one came back from his disc injury it was kind of awkward but melrose appointed anointed tgo as captain immediately upon his return after which he did not score a goal for something like qqq games i think luc should have remained captain all season .,1
funny you should mention this one time on hnic don cherry pointed out vanbiesbrouck s mask he _ hated _ it i think he said something to the effect of you see he was great last year now he goes out and gets that dopey mask and he ca n t stop a beachball you may or may not take cherry seriously at all but i cracked up when i heard it .,1
i do n t have a history handy but i do n t recall that the preponderance of roy s come from winning teams in fact i think team performance is generally irrelevant as almost always the most deserving candidate wins am i wrong and he is not necessarily on a losing team while the angels staff is still very weak their everyday lineup is doing quite well thank you snow is playing great salmon is learning to make the adjustments easley appears fine but even if he s not flora is ready to come up between gonzales and gruber they ll manage the hot corner polonia and curtis are steady and heady even myers and orton are contributing personally i think they can finish over qqq which makes them a winning team the beastmaster,0

wow this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team boston which sweeney you ask well of course bob sweeney the one that boston let buffalo get a hold of they still have qqq sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing game winner in ot in game qqq and another big goal seconds after fuhr made qqq point blank saves this is why grant has qqq rings to put buffalo ahead in the qqq yes neely countered a minute later but had n t this course of buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities i think boston would have notched their first win of the series well the sabres have n t made it to the end of this series yet but i certainly feel they ve got boston right were they want them actually they ve got them in a position that neither buffalo nor boston felt that would come about one more astronomical game by fuhr a few more heroics by the rest of the team this is a team sport afterall and i think borque neely jouneau sp and company are gon na be swinging a new stick weather is perfect for golf season real soon i m not gon na waiger anything on this because i ve seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey talking about golf was that a hockey swing golf swing or baseball swing that hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that khmylev deflected in for the big one the whole ot all qqq minute of it was a tesiment to buffalo s ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end something they were n t necessarily in the regular season the sabres pushed hard and forced borque to blatently take down bodger in the opening seconds i do n t normally like penalties being called in such ultra critical points but this was blatent finally the sabres won a faceoff they were n t that hot in this dept the rest of the game when lafontaine scooped at the puck qqq times when hawerchuck took his shot quite a boomer but blue stopped this one he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again without setting it up i did n t realize it went in until the announcer started screaming they score they score the best was seeing lafontaine jumping up and down skating a little bit jumping some more and then skating over to brad may who he jumped on .,1
all of this is fine i never said that murray was a bad gm i merely said that he is n t the best gm in hockey or even a contender for that honor if murray is as great as you claim the wings would have won the stanley cup by now probably more than once if he was as great a gm as you claim and he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success but murray is an average unspectacular nhl coach and a pretty good gm so none of this is true anyway .,1
pierre for purposes of the tie breaker you only count the first three games in each city therefore quebec can not possibly be ahead of montreal qqq qqq and there s probably only one game that counts remaining between boston and quebec which means boston has probably already won .,1
about qqq is correct for numminen and lumme no kurri s points are too low qqq for kurri and qqq for sel nne that s true game is so different here in europe compared to nhl north ame ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks an average european player from sweden finland russian or tsech slovakia is a better skater and puckhandler than his nhl colleague especially defenders in nhl are mainly slow and clumsy sel nne has also said that in the finnish sm league game is more based on skill than in nhl in finland he could n t get so many breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in nhl also alpo suhonen said that in nhl sel nne s speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen i have to admit that the best players come from canada but those regulars are n t as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues also top europeans are in the same level as the best north americans except lemieux is in the class of his own .,1
the problem is that by no fault of espn ongoing games are not covered til the final horn sounds with two channels scny and sca late finishing games up to pacific time and overtimes elsewhere will kick in at the end of local coverage if scny is blocked by the mets there is still some hockey on sca scny plus with an espn qqq the current situation would be alleviated gld,1

sorry len this is exactly how he suffered from being rushed to the bigs being overweight and having no work ethic leading to being injury prone with nothing to loose might have been corrected in richmond did you intend a smiley after your comment this brings back the long suffering memories of pre chop braves fans who kept being promised the bob horner dale murphy back to back power slam who could stop that guess we ll never know p s rocky fans are there any yet is dale getting any playing time out there i plan to be at the game on june qqq they ll have to play him then .,0
the keenan hiring is precipitated by the loss of an anticipated qqq m in playoff revenue and fears of losing season ticket holders plus paramount chief stan jaffe s chip against the flyers over l affaire lindros last autumn add to this that neilsen might return as an assistant coach gerald what d i say earlier today and roger conferred with jaffe on the hiring this hiring by jaffe went over the head of msg inc par subsidiary head bob gutkowski and over the head and the protests of pres gm neil smith msg is making the announcement on saturday to get back at the islanders for making the playoffs i e steal the press flyers owner ed snyder is livid and beside himself over this keenan will make up to qqq yr gary bettman has appointed an independent consul to look at gil stein s admission into the hall of fame new crease colours rather than blue the oilers will charge to eat in the press room next year gld,1
as i have read this net the last few days i am continually amazed at the pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals especially when it comes down to saying that the bosox have n t a prayer as a long time red sox fan i will simply say the impossible dream year qqq for those of you with short memories short lives or both to be a red sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow the hot team this statement is supported based on the increased number of brave woofers out on the net a true fan of a team any team will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years and be amply rewarded when the time is right yeah so what if buckner let a roller go through his legs in qqq who cares if clemens told cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower the fact is they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them now that it appears that they are on lean times the number of detracters come from all over so what let them play and we will see what happens come september the red sox may not be that good but they are certainly not that bad either and they do have a chance to win the world series after all remember the qqq mets who would have given them a chance to even make it that far let alone beat baltimore let s face it baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than football and basketball because of this one can never say with absolute certainity what the outcome will be over the course of qqq games .,0
ah so you finally found a use for that super slo mo and frame advance other than scrutinizing sorority babes in heat congrats trust me you d have a helluva time manipulating them besides if you converted the film to video you d have all kinds of artifacts because of the difference in frame rate unless you re an expert at doing qqq pulldown for a laserdisc company or something hey no fair what about fettucine alfredo griffin the guy practically has to pivot the bat around along with his body daulton does n t strike me as all that strange he s a little bit quiet at the plate but like franco gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level plane the first time i watched julio franco i did n t think anyone could hit like that now i marvel at how easy he makes it look every time he makes contact it s solid he s got good power to all fields and rarely is he caught not ready for a pitch i wonder if phil plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to practice his swing while on the throne sure looks like it how bout one to add to your list travis fryman the guy plants his front foot and seems to swing across his body he generates a lot of power but i keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot out of his hips well they re already spoken for by several people but i d add robbie alomar s name to the list among others i really like dean palmer s swing for some twisted reason as well as pedro munoz s swing a thought about may it looks like they ve taught him to turn on the ball imho he s going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling off the ball to the point that he s going to see lots of sinkers sliders low and away unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left and left center imho you re going to see a good number of weak grounders to the right side of the infield in the next month .,0

not always true in fact in the case of doug gilmour he actually praises them europeans that do those things are scum in cherry s opinion canadian kids that do them are tough just like a real canadian ulf samuelsson cheap shots mark messier s ribs and don wants ulf s head doug gilmour breaks tomas sandstrom s arm and don says sandstrom had it coming methinks don is either very confused or just a bigot most likely the latter i used to like don cherry i thought he was great but i m starting to see his true colors redneck and the more i see of them the more i think he s just an asshole .,1

hi there i m german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now there are many problems occuring for me one of them is the era statistic for pitchers what does it say era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game thus if a pitcher pitched qqq innings and gave up qqq earned run his qqq inning equivelent perfomance would be qqq earned runs thus his era is qqq to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by qqq era er ip qqq an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error more specifically if an error occurs that represented the third out all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game here are some examples if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base if an error occurs that represents the third out all of the runs after this error and not counted as earned runs if a pitcher issues some base on balls walks and leaves the game before the inning is completed he is responsible for the people who were left on base if the those runners who were left on base score and the score was not a result of an error those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game i hope this explains things for you .,0
first of all i think when espn covers the game they do a wonderful job but last night i felt the same way i really hate watching devils pens game everyone knows that devils are going to get their ass kicked why even bother showing them i was so bored and these espn people do n t seem to have any brain after the sundays and last night games they are still going to show devils pens on thu and sun what the hell are they thinking about i think if they keep it up like this nhl will never get a major network contract i d rather see caps isls game which is more exciting now i just hope all baseball games are rained out on espn so atleast we can get diffrent hockey games .,1

i am an ulf and pgh fan and what pisses me off about the whole adam graves ulf samuesson debate is that ulf plays hard hitting hockey nothing wrong with that while graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to intentionally hurt someone which bites i thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap like that is it just me or does the officiating just still stink to high heaven imho if they could get rid of the existing refs and institute a new system with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble makers then a lot of these things would stop and then the game would be ruled by the finnesse players mario selanne bure messier et al .,1

never was probably is not now debatable what other valid test can you think of besides the final standings or divisional playoff winner what do you propose a worthless vote like they do in college football what a joke if i remember right brad park was also involved in that trade he was n t all that bad a hockey player but let s look at some of sinden s trades over the years for rick middleton rangers i do n t know who sinden gave up for middle ton so i ll call this one a barry pederson for cam neely canucks any questions greg hawgood for vladimir ruzicka oilers didja see that one rosie roofed against roy in last year s playoffs courtnall ranford for andy moog oilers a wash moog is a good goaltender ranford burned boston in the finals in his first year and courtnall always seems to get his points anyone in vancouver care to comment on courtnall as a defensive liability ken linseman for dave poulin flyers any more questions janney quintal for adam oates blues janney is an enormous talent and a personable guy the the bruins play in adam s division enough said so even if you count the esposito vadnais ratelle park i do n t remember who else joe zanussi trade as a double minus harry the horse trader comes out on top i submit that the bruins are always good because of harry not in spite of him btw do you really think the habs will bounce back next season i ll bet they finish fourth or fifth in the conference behind any of the following pittsburgh quebec boston washington islanders someone correct me if these five teams will not be in montreal s conference in summary things look bleak for the habs at least in the near future i suspect that the next team from la belle province to win the cup will be that team that lindros did n t want to play for dan lyddy daniell cory berkeley edu university of california at berkeley,1

on tuesday when it was raining in chicago espn provided bonus hockey coverage now it seems as though some fans are ticked off that the ny wash ot was replaced with the angels game people must realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the u s the baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so they ca n t skip the baseball game why do n t you people chill out and enjoy whatever coverage you can get well partly because i as an ardent fan of both sports would rather see game qqq of the nhl playoffs than game qqq of qqq of the mlb season even if the bb game involves the red sox espn may have had contractual obligations i understand that part but it s a bit inaccurate to call us selfish just because we want to watch the watch the game we love am i as a baseball fan selfish when i get pissed a cbs for showing approximately one game per month i do n t think so while espn may have contractual obligations we as their consumers have a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us there s certainly nothing wrong with that .,1

and it is a damn good thing that she did post it since she claims to represent people in rec sport hockey her sole purpose in mentioning the net as steve gallichio has already pointed out is to lend weight to her points through association with the internet there is no other reason to mention the internet this is misrepresentation and if the internet was a private corporation alison would be leaving herself wide open to all kinds of civil suits this is not a letter it is a petition claiming to represent a large proportion of rec sport hockey users and by implication a significant number of internet users qqq names can in no way be considered a large proportion of rec sport hockey which while we have no way of counting actual readership is accessible to hundreds of thousands of people qqq persons is no more than a fly s fart in a windstorm gee you looked up large in the dictionary what next two syllable words let me suggest that the only place you are likely to envy the magnitude of qqq is when you are looking for ways to beef up your iq scores as i said he might be impressed by the size of the list of names but it would have to be considerably larger but even this definition does not account for the original context from which you lifted this sentence well then what the hell is your point you do n t really know if you have an opinion about the hockey issue but you do know that you do n t like me is that it -,1
punch imlach s contributions as a coach and gm were far greater than those of the above combined should we name a division or trophy after him smythe and norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they were powerful owners as owners they certainly did help to build the league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether are we going to honour those who contributed to the league s evolution or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the sport itself i ca n t disagree with you here what have you heard the major was the definitive little asshole he originated the phrase if you ca n t beat em in the alley you ca n t beat em on the ice that was his idea of hockey do you think by chance that don cherry is a classy individual the money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on and that is it is the players that are what make the game great and not the people who put them on the ice exactly true naming divisions and trophies after smythe and the bunch is the same kind of nepotism that put stein in the hall of fame i have always thought that this was nonsense -,1

i like the clark williams bonds order pitchers can only walk clark with qqq outs unlike last year williams is getting better pitches to hit with bonds looming in the on deck circle since matt has a terrible batting eye this helps the giants a lot when bonds gets on base all by himself he can try to steal qqq and then be driven in with a single by thompson manwaring or clayton if you bat bonds before the other sluggers then you do n t want him to run because a caught stealing could take you out of a big inning also bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer a walk is a potential double the only draw back is when clark and williams are clogging up the bases infront of bonds and i think that s a problem the giants will be glad to see especially if robby thompson gets hot .,0
if team yeah but soderstrom s mask has always appeared to be a lot bigger than the average helmet and cage variety it has a certain appeal on its own josh,1
let s start over i m not arguing about who is the better goaltender i d take soderstrom right now what i am saying is that roussel can be a qqq netminder the gaa difference is less than half a goal per game less than that after last night their save percentages are close and their records are similar and with that i just do n t see how you can label roussel as the most disappointing player on the flyers this season you say soderstrom played against better competition that may very well be but there is no way of knowing how roussel would have performed in those games besides against the better scoring teams like pittsburgh the defense is more keyed up than they are against san jose but i m not just judging roussel on that game alone i ve seen him play for the past two seasons in philly and before that in hershey it s just my opinion but i think he s got what it takes of course i thought that about mark laforest too but i never did about wendell young so i m batting qqq in judging hershey talent since the hextall era as for the rangers game you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like but rou had his leg in position to make the save if he did n t it would n t have mattered if the rangers player did n t get the puck up or not it would have been a goal on a breakaway that s what the goalie wants to do take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him i seem to remember roussel doing an excellent job against pittsurgh on opening night to give the flyers a tie against the two time defending champs and not to take anything away from soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the habs but you ca n t tell me that a montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it mistakes both on offense and defense are part of the game or there d never be shutouts anyway i m happy the flyers have both soderstrom and roussel and i m not going to argue about it anymore besides with the current qqq winning streak and expectations soaring for next year i do n t want to piss you off to the point that you do n t sell me any tickets next season .,1
well bruins fans it s playoff time again it looks like the b s have peaked at the right time getting out of the adams is going to be a cat fight to the end after what they did to montreal and quebec these teams will be out for revenge if neely can stay healthy and both bourque and moog stay sharp we should get to see neely finally take out two years of frustration on ulf i do n t fight samuelson i do n t agree with fighting in the nhl but if there is one guy who deserves to be taken out good it s him this is going to be a good series go bruins !,1
generally i agree with you however qqq last night espn cut away to baseball tonite which looks like sportscenter tailored to baseball and they cut away at qqq pacific that s quite a contract they have there qqq if espn could n t deliver they should have had a transistion plan to let sportschannel pick up the slack nonetheless it is ultimately the fault of the us american public that regular season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the u s support your team support your game somebody in r s h had an excellent idea that we should write chrysler to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would consider their products here s an equally excellent idea watch baseball for qqq minutes i know i m asking a lot but that s what spew bags are for write down who is advertising and write them letters complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and that you wo n t consider buying their products because of it .,1

it was not krupp s skate krupp was defending against steve tuttle of the blues they both sort of tripped and fell toward malarchuk and tuttle s skate came perilously close to cutting but actually just missed the jugular malarchuk immediately fell to the ice hands at his neck blood on the ice he d been suffering from it for over a decade he just was n t diagnosed for it until he did n t sleep for ten days and decided to have some alcohol to help him sleep unfortunately he d just been put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier it s amazing he lasted as long as he did ocd sufferers stop distinguishing the line between reality and imagination or fail to accept that something they ve checked is ok now for example an ocd sufferrer can wash his hands over and over and still think they re dirty he might check the oven ten times to be sure it s turned off he might see a movie about something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his own life malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes but still needs it he went off it this past winter and had a bad ocd episode and i think was in the hospital for a couple days he felt it slowed his reflexes so he tried to go without in any event he is alive and well and living in san diego while playing with the gulls ihl and tuttle is no longer with the blues but i do n t know where he is possibly in the ihl but you d best ask a blues fan .,1

do you really have that much information on him really i do n t know you tell me what percentage of players reach or exceed their mle s in their rookie season we re talking about qqq you know if that were your purpose maybe offerman spent qqq getting acclimated if you will the dodgers as a team paid a big price that season perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road do you really think they would have done what they did if they were competing for a pennant for a stat head i m amazed that you put any credence in spring training did you notice who he got those qqq hits off of or are you going to tell me that it does n t make a difference wait a minute i missed something here first forget keith mitchell are you saying that a kid who moves from aa to aaa and then does not improve would have been better off making a direct leap to the majors if a player does well at aa and then does not improve at aaa is n t that a sign that maybe he does n t belong in the bigs now keith mitchell as i recall no stat books handy surprise he jumped from aa to atlanta in qqq he did so well that he was returned to the minors where he did n t do very well at all now his career is in jeopardy so how does he fit in with your point good mle s in aa moved him right to the big club now he s one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball duh well i ve cast my lot certainly you may understand better how good lopez is and i may overvalue experience but neither one of us runs a baseball team the beastmaster,0
i think you missed one of my points there it takes more than a great gm to win a stanley cup even once some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one i agree that you and i could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best gm in hockey that is a matter of opinion and who is to say my opinion is any better than yours or yours than mine but the point of my original original post if not well stated was that murray has the gm abilities but not the coaching abilities which leads to below i think at this point there s a personal emotional element involved here which transcends murray s logical thought as outsiders it s fine for us to say he should hire a different coach in fact he has talked about doing so in the past but the press here in detroit at least has so built up this business about murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach that i think he has taken it upon himself to prove to the world that he is capable of coaching a team past the second round he needs to as the papers say get that monkey off his back so it becomes a matter not of intelligence but of pride is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic perhaps but we re all a little that way from time to time i think eventually he ll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his gm duties and the team will improve as a result i think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on gm work in that sense once he steps down as coach we ll see how good of a gm he really is i may not agree with everything you ve said but it s been fun discussing it with you .,1

just to add to this vein consider that range of a first baseman is not the only important thing he is imo the best fielder of bad throws from the other infielders i have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt catch balls off a large bounce take down balls over his head wide etc ad infinitum and he gets the out much of the time some of the things he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing you have to give mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot near the bag yes i am sure he gets a few calls because he is mattingly ),0

i agree that keenan is an excellent choice did you see mike lupica s column in sunday s news my sentiments exactly i think he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire into their hearts next season either that or he s going to be kicking alot of butt i m here but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly quiet you know doing the lurking thing i do n t have a sense how many rangers fans there are on the list either i am a die hard ranger fan i guess i have to be i sat in the garden throughout the penguins led by mario s qqq goals decimation of them on qqq but am sick at the abundance of talent that has been totally untapped and the lack of heart displayed this season hurlbut was injured for quite a while i m not sure but i think he may have recovered in time for the playoff run and if so like you question why he was n t used i believe kocur was used in many instances for his intimidation factor granted he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for that reason alone but you have to realize that when a team is not doing any real physical intimidation i d like to have a nickel for every time j d said they ve got to take the body more you ve got to at least have some illusions i agree and i do n t know sorry i do n t agree with you here i think joey c did a good job filling in when he was asked to i ca n t imagine that it s easy going from near qqq ice time to being a full timer i do n t seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too much or failing to clear the zone he worked hard and at least did n t make any rookie mistakes as he said himself in an interview he can only give what he has and he did absolutely i think attendance at the garden was better on the last day of the season than any average night for the islanders the man is awesome in a way i m enjoying the playoffs more now that the rangers are n t in them i can really appreciate all the glory mario is getting without hating him because he s on the opposing team he deserves it all as far as i m concerned mary,1

the problem with your nihilistic approach roger is that it takes all the sense out of the game by your line of reasoning if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded there s no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do if his team won anyway or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons after all any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but did n t roger do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead or are you willing to consider empirical evidence teams go to the post season when they win more games than anybody else in their division if they do n t make the post season they do n t win the series will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring collecting if so you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games in your viewpoint as expressed winning games happens for reasons that can not be analyzed while many of us are thinking things like base runners are good outs are bad and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded you are thinking things like it s a team game so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today the result is that it becomes impossible to say anything about individual players perhaps atlanta would have won the series with me playing left field after all perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it therefore i could be an extremely valuable player did dave winfield have anything to do with the jays victory probably but how do you know if you replace him with andres galarraga perhaps the jays would have won perhaps they would have lost perhaps they would have defected to alpha centauri bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid season had winfield been dhing for toronto was babe ruth a good player he played on some ws winning teams but did he have anything to do with their success it is generally accepted that ernie banks was a good baseball player and jarvis brown and dan schatzeder were n t it seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof now we have observed things about baseball over the years both empirically and by looking at the rulebook it is necessary to score more runs than one s opponent to win the game so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one s opponent from scoring runs are scored while a team is batting and an inning ends after the third out so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year we do use these statistics to predict winners and so do you to make some flat predictions barry bonds will have a higher obp slg than gene larkin this year the braves will finish ahead of the rockies in the standings the tigers will score more runs than the royals but will also give up more i would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false and i suspect so would you as a matter of fact i am pretty sure i can predict all the division winners this year given qqq qqq guesses per division and this is certainly better than random chance and almost statistically significant if you will admit that the rockies and mariners are unlikely to meet in the world series you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods however fuzzy so how about real life person a robs a service station with two people in it using a qqq automatic pistol gets qqq and is convicted and sentenced for three years person b with a similar criminal record robs a service station with two people in it using a qqq revolver gets qqq and is convicted since they used two different types of handgun are comparisons totally meaningless say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works my cats are always testing this they do n t trust me to pay the gravity bill on time you have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before so all previous evidence is meaningless or would you be surprised if it flew out the window instead of hitting the desk ?,0
lloyd pettit yes it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the nhl for qqq m but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much less than that he felt that no one would pay qqq m for an expansion team and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that but the market fooled him and qqq teams have been created for qqq m apiece in the last three years and even the existing teams ca n t be moved for less than qqq m and i doubt that he could get one for that little pettit gambled and lost now he ll have to pay more .,1

the first time i heard this piece of news was on the post game radio interview here in jyvaskyla that was the bronze medal game in the sm liiga which tichonov s team porin assat the aces of town pori lost vasili the son of victor tichonov the famous soviet coach said that for a long time the sharks have been persuading him to take the assistant coach post but he wants to be the head coach where ever he goes he definitely wo n t be coaching assat anymore after three seasons i do n t know why vasili is a good coach i believe assat was a good team produced many players to our national team assat was n t a skilled team imho but they had the fighting spirit after all they butchered jokerit in the playoffs and gave hard time to tps the champs but assat was n t consistent only when they were in the right mood they could beat any team in the sm liiga i am not qqq sure about the deal with the sharks as i said he wants to be the head coach but he and the sharks are going to negotiate and decide during the wc i doubt that he will be the head coach but maybe they ll do some compromise .,1

it s just as meaningless to compare goals assists pim and any other stat i can think of each player is asked to take a unique role for his team the contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the same team or different teams and yet awards are given and promotions received based in part on these meaningless stats the operative words are in part stats must be interpreted tempered with other information one has about the player and comparing jagr s and francis s points is just as ridiculous and absurd but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals assists points for selanne lindros juneau potvin and the other rookies in the league and yet how about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game .,1
"i watched the final inning of bosio s no hitter with several people at work after vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove he would n t have had time to throw riles out yet the throw beat riles by about two steps i wonder how many others who watched the final out think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand in this morning s paper or was it on the radio vizquel was quoted as saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still easily thrown out riles that he barehanded it instead so as to make the final play more memorable seems a litle cocky to me but he made it work so he s entitled i guess so still that s kind of a stupid move imo he d be singing a different tune if he had booted it and the next guy up had hit a bloop single stranger things have happened hey i used to be a big dave stieb fan and unfortunately there s no such thing as an unearned hit cheers ,",0

joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball for anyone who did n t see sunday s game with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform a left handed hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford a qqq hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis alicea a qqq hitter with no power as a pinch hitter what the hell is he thinking earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt but torre said he liked gilkey coming off the bench gilkey hit over qqq last year what does he have to do to start the guy would be starting on most every team in the league furthermore in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line and waving lankford home i ca n t take this anymore brian a very distressed cardinal fan -,0
until six or seven years ago i was an enthusiastic fan of nfl football last year i hardly watched a game what turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game a team scores qqq minutes of commercials kickoff qqq minutes of commercials three downs and a punt qqq minutes of commercials aaaaarrrrgh earlier in this thread i commented on larussa and the a s whom i believe institutionalize slow play i do n t mind the cat and mouse game with rickey on first in fact i rather enjoy it similarly i would enjoy the battle with listach or lofton or polonia on first what i object to is when such games are played with karkovice on first or when the game is a blowout i do n t mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration what i object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity when a game is exciting these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game when the delays happen with regularity they become nuisances just like the commercial breaks in football i understand the nfl imposed a number of rule changes to speed up the games basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster that did not address the problem of the continuity of the game it may have appeased the sponsors and the networks but i would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans similary while some qqq baseball games bore me to tears those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch i doubt if anyone watching the braves giants game cared about gant stepping out i doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present i would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball on the other hand i wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with alderson larussa duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games out the way that they do i sure would n t mind a little arm twisting there the beastmaster,0
this was my opinion the stupidest thing in the hidden game the argument was qqq defense or runs allowed is qqq of the game qqq unearned runs amount to qqq of the runs allowed earned runs qqq qqq since unearned runs are the result of fielding not pitching and earned runs are the product of pitching not fielding fielding is qqq of defense and pitching is qqq of defense qqq caombining with qqq pitching is qqq of the game fielding qqq pete is usually sharper than that my own feel is that fielding is in the qqq qqq of defense range call it qqq qqq between fielding and pitching i d give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe qqq qqq or even qqq qqq give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds identical batting stats which would n t be that unreasonable and even if you do n t let roberto steal a single base they ll score a lot more than the oleruds by going first to third more often no offense gordon .,0
